   1. Magnetic field is now defined as default field, not attached 
      to any particular volume. The standard geometry file, geom_01.txt, 
      is updated: the new default magnetic field map is now "Mau4" - the 
      latest map, provided by TD. It is still possible to use uniform 
      field in DS (downstream only or the whole DS).

      The default geometry loads the full map - which includes PS, TS and 
      DS. The framework startup time is now significantly longer - about 
      50 seconds on ilcsim2. For many studies only DS field is relevant. 
      File Mu2eG4/test/geom_dsfield.txt provides example how to describe 
      field only in DS (in can be used instead of geom_01.txt). That speeds 
      up the load time to 20 seconds. 

      It is possible to defined no magnetic field at all. For that, use 
      the following line in configuration:
      vector<string> bfield.files = { };

   2. The default torus radius is changed from 2926 mm to 2929 mm. The new 
      value is the default in all beamline studies and the TD B-field maps
      are calculated using R=2929 mm. 

      The position of the stopping target, tracker, etc., did not change. 
      But the end of TS5 moved by 3 mm, thus the distance between end of
      the last collimator and stopping target has been reduced by 3 mm.

   3. Two more virtual detectors are added. VD #9 is placed just before 
      the stopping target, VD #10 is placed after the stopping targer, 
      just before the proton absorber. The proton absorber has been moved 
      downstream by 0.1 mm - thisckness of virtual detector. Radially these 
      two virtual detectors extend to neutron absorder. 

   4. Removed annoing printout from StackinAction

   5. Fixed typo in beamline_genconfig.txt
