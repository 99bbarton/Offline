    Changed the way calorimeter constructed in Mu2eG4/src/constructCalorimeter.cc.

    The old way was to construct one full crystal (wrapped, with readouts) and then
    to place it many time. That approach allowed to save some memory, but is very
    inconvenient when one needs to track in which volume the particular hit occured.

    In the new code each crystal is constructed separately. Thus the total number of
    physics volumes in the calorimeter increased by a factor 4 (or so). The 
    advantage now is that all these volumes are easily tracked in the latter analysis.

    Second part of the fix to the magnetic field problems that have been
    discussed on the mu2e-sim list in the last two days.  

    The field map is defined on the rectangular grid of points. In the TD maps 
    the field is present for all the points. In the MECO maps the field is defined
    only in the cylindrical part of the grid. Previously the B-field was set only 
    inside DS, TS and PS vacuum, thus the field was never requested for that part 
    of the grid, where the field was not defined. After B-field was described as
    global (see item 5, February 13), unattached to any volume, G4 started to 
    request for field at any position. There was a bug in the existing code which 
    lead to the wrong field value in the boundary region between defined and undefined 
    points.

    This problem has been fixed and the simulation now works correctly as with 
    TD maps as with MECO maps, and can handle points on the grid where field is
    not defined.

    I've added geometry configuration file Mu2eG4/test/geom_mecofield.txt, which
    has geometry properly tuned to use old MECO maps. Use it for corresponding 
    studies. The default field map in geom_01.txt is the latest TD map.

    First part of the fix to the magnetic field problems that have been
    discussed on the mu2e-sim list in the last two days.  

    With this fix the TD field is working correctly.

    There are two problems.  The first is easy to solve: MECO and TD choose
    different sign conventions: MECO field is in the -z direction and
    the TD field is in the +z direction.  The other problem will be discussed
    when that fix is commited.

    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
      - Vanya changed the direction of the uniform field to match the TD convention
           double toyDS.bz = +1.0;
      - I added a reminder that the torus radius needs to change when you uncomment
        the MECO field description.

   Added comments to stopping target example in ReadBack.cc 
   (function doStoppingTarget()), and made the code slightly more 
   efficient.

   The limitation on cos theta for the generation of ejected protons is
   removed. Now they are producted isotropically. Two configuration files:
     Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
     Analyses/test/genconfig_Bkg.txt
   and the default option in 
     EventGenerator/src/EjectedProtonGun.cc
   have been changed.

   Stopping target foils are now sensitive detectors. There is new output 
   StepPointMCCollection with the name "stoppingtarget". This collection
   holds all G4 steps occured in the stopping target foils.

   There is example in ReadBack.cc of how to use these data, function
   doStoppingTarget(). In this example four histograms are filled: 
   the total energy deposition in the target, the total path length and 
   the number of foils crossed by the particle. There is 2D version of 
   the last histogram, where number of crossed foils is shown versus 
   the id of the foil of origin. All these histograms are in "checkhits"
   folder, with the name, starting from "hTarget".

   1. Magnetic field is now defined as default field, not attached 
      to any particular volume. The standard geometry file, geom_01.txt, 
      is updated: the new default magnetic field map is now "Mau4" - the 
      latest map, provided by TD. It is still possible to use uniform 
      field in DS (downstream only or the whole DS).

      The default geometry loads the full map - which includes PS, TS and 
      DS. The framework startup time is now significantly longer - about 
      50 seconds on ilcsim2. For many studies only DS field is relevant. 
      File Mu2eG4/test/geom_dsfield.txt provides example how to describe 
      field only in DS (in can be used instead of geom_01.txt). That speeds 
      up the load time to 20 seconds. 

      It is possible to defined no magnetic field at all. For that, use 
      the following line in configuration:
      vector<string> bfield.files = { };

   2. The default torus radius is changed from 2926 mm to 2929 mm. The new 
      value is the default in all beamline studies and the TD B-field maps
      are calculated using R=2929 mm. 

      The position of the stopping target, tracker, etc., did not change. 
      But the end of TS5 moved by 3 mm, thus the distance between end of
      the last collimator and stopping target has been reduced by 3 mm.

   3. Two more virtual detectors are added. VD #9 is placed just before 
      the stopping target, VD #10 is placed after the stopping targer, 
      just before the proton absorber. The proton absorber has been moved 
      downstream by 0.1 mm - thisckness of virtual detector. Radially these 
      two virtual detectors extend to neutron absorder. 

   4. Removed annoing printout from StackinAction

   5. Fixed typo in beamline_genconfig.txt
