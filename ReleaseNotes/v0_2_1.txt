    Small change in HitMaker/src/MakeStrawHit_plugin.cc - delta time 
    is now properly calculated as the time difference between the 
    earliest signals at the two ends of the wire, which could be 
    generated by different G4Steps. In the previous version it was 
    calculated as the time difference between the signals originated 
    from the same G4Step.

    Added two new directories: BeamlineGeom and VirtualDetectorGeom.
    BeamlineGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for beamline 
                  elements. Right now only used for TS and collimator 
		  elements.
    VirtualDetectorGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for 
                         virtual detectors. Right now virtual detectors 
			 are placed around each collimator.  
    geom_01.txt file is updated - added collimators and virtual detectors.
    Significant update to Mu2eWorld.
    New sensitive detector - VirtualDetectorSD. G4 plugin now produces 
    two output StepPointMC collections, thus an additional qualifier 
    should be used in getByLabel(). I've updated all existing getByLabel() 
    calls.
