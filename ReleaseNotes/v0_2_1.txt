    Added two new directories: BeamlineGeom and VirtualDetectorGeom.
    BeamlineGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for beamline elements. 
                  Right now only used for TS and collimator elements.
    VirtualDetectorGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for virtual detectors.
                         Right now virtual detectors are placed around each collimator. 
    geom_01.txt file is updated - added collimators and virtual detectors.
    Significant update to Mu2eWorld.
    New sensitive detector - VirtualDetectorSD. G4 plugin now produces two output 
    StepPointMC collections, thus an additional qualifier should be used in getByLabel(). 
    I've updated all existing getByLabel() calls.
