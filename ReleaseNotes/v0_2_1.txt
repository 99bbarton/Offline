    Added g4 vis macro with a different view point and absolute pad/zoom examples
      Mu2eG4/test/vis45.mac
    Commented out CRVFrontShield & HallSteelFrontHole volumes due to their overlaps with TS4
    to be redone with volume subtraction
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc

    Enabled g4 surface check and extended handling of the g4 visibility attributes to more components
      Mu2eG4/inc/constructStoppingTarget.hh               
      Mu2eG4/inc/nestBox.hh

      Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v0.txt

    g4 surface check (a.k.a. overlap test is off by default, note that it draws random numbers)


 4) August 31, 2010, kutschke
    Bug fix to:
      EventGenerator/src/FromG4BLFile.cc

    Example of how to use FromG4BLFile:
      Mu2eG4/test/beamline_genconfig.txt
      Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt

    Next release of FromG4BLFile generator.  This still does not treat the
    weight correctly and it is not yet fully tested.  It is off by default.
      EventGenerator/inc/FromG4BLFile.hh
      EventGenerator/src/FromG4BLFile.cc

    Add fromG4BLFile to the enum
      ToyDP/inc/GenId.hh

    Add FromG4BLFile to the list of generators.
      EventGenerator/src/EventGenerator_plugin.cc

    Handle the case of fromG4BLFile.0
      Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

 2) August 30, 2010, logash

    Small change in HitMaker/src/MakeStrawHit_plugin.cc - delta time 
    is now properly calculated as the time difference between the 
    earliest signals at the two ends of the wire, which could be 
    generated by different G4Steps. In the previous version it was 
    calculated as the time difference between the signals originated 
    from the same G4Step.

    Added two new directories: BeamlineGeom and VirtualDetectorGeom.
    BeamlineGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for beamline 
                  elements. Right now only used for TS and collimator 
		  elements.
    VirtualDetectorGeom: geometry service to hold geometry info for 
                         virtual detectors. Right now virtual detectors 
			 are placed around each collimator.  
    geom_01.txt file is updated - added collimators and virtual detectors.
    Significant update to Mu2eWorld.
    New sensitive detector - VirtualDetectorSD. G4 plugin now produces 
    two output StepPointMC collections, thus an additional qualifier 
    should be used in getByLabel(). I've updated all existing getByLabel() 
    calls.
