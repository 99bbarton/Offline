 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_1_0

8) December 19, 2012 kutschke
   SConstruct
    - Only check for the existence of the directory BaBar/Dch if
      the directory BaBar exists.
    - This is needed so that SConstruct works as is with test releases that
      do not have checked out BaBar code.

   Added comments on how to preform a geant4 "particle timing test" using:
   Analyses/test/simParticleCheck00.fcl

   Template WorldMaker on MaterialsType in addition to WorldType, and
   allow to use non-default-constructed world and materials objects.

   Make saving G4 steps in the StudySteppingAction conditional on the
   newly introduced g4.steppingActionSaveSteps SimpleConfig boolean.

   VolumeInfo::mu2eOriginInWorld() will assume (0,0,0) if WorldG4 is
   not present int the geometry.  This is to make it work with the
   simple "study" geometries.

  Improvements to the Helix fit used to see the Kalman filter fit.
  Move most HelixFit functions back to private, and update TrkHelixFitIT
  and ITrackReco_module accordingly.
