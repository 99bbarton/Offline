 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_0_0

4) July 2, kutschke
   A new class that is a placeholder for code that persist Kalman filtered
   tracks.  So far it just put an empty collection into the event.
     TrkPatRec/inc/PayloadSaver.hh
     TrkPatRec/src/PayloadSaver.cc

   Incorporated the above class into the module that creates tracks.
    TrkPatRec/src/TrkPatRec_module.cc

3) July 2, kutschke
   Committed some prototypes ( and some placeholders ) for the classes that
   will eventually store the persistent information for fitted tracks.
   New files:
     RecoDataProducts/inc/HOTPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepExtensionPayload.hh

     RecoDataProducts/src/KalRepExtensionPayload.cc
     RecoDataProducts/src/KalRepPayload.cc
     RecoDataProducts/src/LocalHelixPayload.cc
   Modified files.

   There used to be stanza in SConstruct that checked to see if the BaBar
   Kalman filter code was present and, if not, removed from the build
   several packages that depend on the Kalman filter code.  Now that the
   Kalman filter code is required, this stanza has been removed.

   There was also a stanza skipping the build of the BaBar Dch package.
   This package has been removed from the checkout so the stanza skipping it
   was removed from SConstruct.

1) July 2, kutschke
   Force checkout of the BaBar code
    setup.sh
    setup_g4951.sh

   Replace .csh with .sh
    BaBar/status.sh
    BaBar/status.csh

   Add additional printout to:
    BaBar/update.sh

   Removed obsolete:
    BaBar/update.csh
