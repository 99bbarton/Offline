 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_0_0

11) July 15, kutschke
    Add examples of how to create the input files for use by event mixing.
    See EventMixing/inputGeneration/README

10) July 10, kutschke
    Add code to control B(pi -> e nu).  The G4 default is zero.
    The new default is to set it to the PDG value.  There is a grammar
    in geom_01.txt to set it to any value on the range [0,1].

    New files:
      Mu2eG4/inc/customizeChargedPionDecay.hh
      Mu2eG4/src/customizeChargedPionDecay.cc

    Modified files:
      Mu2eG4/src/postG4InitializeTasks.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

    New files to look at the SimParticleCollection and count the number
    of decays to e nu decays and mu nu decays in the events.
      Analyses/src/CountPionDecays_module.cc
      Analyses/test/countPionDecays.fcl

9) July 10, kutschke
   Make -O3 the default compilation option.  It had been set to -O0.

8) July 10, kutschke
   KalmanTests/inc/TrkRecoTrkCollection.hh
    - included BaBar/BaBar.hh
    - previously the code worked accidentally because BaBar.h
      was included via other #included headers.

7) July 9, gianipez
   Add correction function for the calculation of the calorimeter-cluster center of gravity
   Modified files
     CaloCluster/inc/CaoClusterUtilities.hh
     CaloCluster/src/CaoClusterUtilities.cc
   Add new directory for doing the extrapolation and the matching of the reconstructed tracks with the calorimeter. 
   It contains two producer modules, one for doing the extrapolation of the reconstructed tracks on the calorimeter (4vanes geometry),
   and the other for doing the matching with the custers. It contains also a new class "TrkToCaloExtrapolation.hh", which is used to fill
   the event with the extrapolation informations.
    TrackCaloMatching/
   Add a new class that is an art::Assn used for filling matching informations into the event
    Modified files:
    RecoDataProducts/inc/TrackClusterLink.hh
   Changed the calorimter 4 vanes geometry, now is 11 rows times 44 columns
    Modified files:
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
   Add new module for studying the pile up in the calorimeter clusters
    CaloCluster/src/CaloClusterPileUp_module.cc

6) July 8, youzy
   Add position cut for Virtual Detector Filter module.
   Modified file
     Analyses/src/FilterVDHits_module.cc 

5) July 3, youzy
   Add beam direction rotation in Primary Proton generator.
   Modified files.
     EventGenerator/src/PrimaryProtonGun.cc
     EventGenerator/inc/PrimaryProtonGun.hh

4) July 2, kutschke
   A new class that is a placeholder for code that persist Kalman filtered
   tracks.  So far it just put an empty collection into the event.
     TrkPatRec/inc/PayloadSaver.hh
     TrkPatRec/src/PayloadSaver.cc

   Incorporated the above class into the module that creates tracks.
    TrkPatRec/src/TrkPatRec_module.cc

3) July 2, kutschke
   Committed some prototypes ( and some placeholders ) for the classes that
   will eventually store the persistent information for fitted tracks.
   New files:
     RecoDataProducts/inc/HOTPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepExtensionPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepExtensionPayloadCollection.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/KalRepPayloadCollection.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/LocalHelixPayload.hh
     RecoDataProducts/inc/LocalHelixPayloadCollection.hh
     RecoDataProducts/src/HOTPayload.cc
     RecoDataProducts/src/KalRepExtensionPayload.cc
     RecoDataProducts/src/KalRepPayload.cc
     RecoDataProducts/src/LocalHelixPayload.cc
   Modified files.
     DataProducts/src/classes.h
     DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
     RecoDataProducts/src/classes.h
     RecoDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml

2) July 2, kutschke
   There used to be stanza in SConstruct that checked to see if the BaBar
   Kalman filter code was present and, if not, removed from the build
   several packages that depend on the Kalman filter code.  Now that the
   Kalman filter code is required, this stanza has been removed.

   There was also a stanza skipping the build of the BaBar Dch package.
   This package has been removed from the checkout so the stanza skipping it
   was removed from SConstruct.

1) July 2, kutschke
   Force checkout of the BaBar code
    setup.sh
    setup_g4951.sh

   Replace .csh with .sh
    BaBar/status.sh
    BaBar/status.csh

   Add additional printout to:
    BaBar/update.sh

   Removed obsolete:
    BaBar/update.csh
