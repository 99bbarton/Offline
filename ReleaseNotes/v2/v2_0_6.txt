           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_0_6

4) November 16, 2012 echenard
   Implementation of the new structure of the calorimeter package 
   with the corresponding interface.
   Added a method in the geometry service to get a handle to the 
   calorimeter (either disk or vanes). 
   Changed code to use the calorimeter interface instead of directly 
   refering to a vane/disk calorimeter.      
   Vanes/disk can be switched in the Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt config 
   file

     When recovering this tag, you must use svn revision 579.
     Add the revision to setup.sh

   BaBar/checkout.sh
     Added an optional argument so that we can checkout selected revisions
     from the svn repository. The optional argument must of the form
     "-r nnn" where nnn is a revision number.

  Finished interface to BaBar Kalman filter fit BField corrections, these can
  be turned on with the 'fieldCorrection' fcl parameter in KalFit (default
  off).  Renamed the fcl parameter controling material corrections
  materialCorrection' to be consistent.  Cleanup the KalContext to
  remove unused variables and inconsistent names, and created a fcl parameter
  in KalFit to control all the data members.  KalFit is now a subclass of
  KalContext so it can provide the authoritative single access to the
  BField, which replaces multiple instances of hard-coded fixed field objects
  in the old code.  Improved the implementation of the BField integration and
  range division.
