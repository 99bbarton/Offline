 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_0_6
1) November 15, 2012 brownd
  Finished interface to BaBar Kalman filter fit BField corrections, these can
  be turned on with the 'fieldCorrection' fcl parameter in KalFit (default
  off).  Renamed the fcl parameter controling material corrections
  materialCorrection' to be consistent.  Cleanup the KalContext to
  remove unused variables and inconsistent names, and created a fcl parameter
  in KalFit to control all the data members.  KalFit is now a subclass of
  KalContext so it can provide the authoritative single access to the
  BField, which replaces multiple instances of hard-coded fixed field objects
  in the old code.  Improved the implementation of the BField integration and
  range division.
