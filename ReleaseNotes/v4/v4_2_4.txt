   Add a new module, TrackCaloMatching/src/TrackCaloMatching_module.cc

   The algorithm is cloned from TrackCaloMatching/src/CaloMatching_module.cc.
   However, the output is stored differently: for each track-cluster match 
   the calculcated match chi2 is also stored.

  Moved DeadStrawList from HitMakers to TrackerConditions to avoid a
