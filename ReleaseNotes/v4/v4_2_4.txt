 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_2_4

6) June 05, 2014 genser

   Added first implementation of Muon Stopping Target Monitor (MSTM);
   Reimplemented windows in constructExternalNeutronShielding using
   G4SubtractionSolid to avoid overlaps with MSTM; 
   Added MSTMCrystal detector

  Added MVA hit cleaning to time peak selection.  Tweaked Helix fit
  parameters.  Affects TrkPatRec

   Update TS pbar window in default geometry:
   a) Add a pbar window at TS1 collimator entrance;
   b) Add a pbar absorber with arc shape in TS1 collimator near exit;
   c) Change thickness of the old pbar window (disk) at TS3 center from
      120 microns to 200 microsn.

   Added code in the Sandbox to illustrate that ranged for loops
   indeed make a copy unless we explicity request a reference:
     for ( auto const & var : container ){ }

    Sandbox/test/rangedFor.fcl


2) Jun 02, 2014 murat

   Add a new module, TrackCaloMatching/src/TrackCaloMatching_module.cc

   The algorithm is cloned from TrackCaloMatching/src/CaloMatching_module.cc.
   However, the output is stored differently: for each track-cluster match 
   the calculcated match chi2 is also stored.

  Moved DeadStrawList from HitMakers to TrackerConditions to avoid a
  dependency problem.  Affects HitMakers TrackerConditions, and TrackerMC.
