           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_1_7

5) March 25, 2014, brownd
    Introduce StrawDigiMC, which summarizes the MC truth information that goes
    into making a StrawDigi.  In particular, this object remembers the MC time
    of the StepPoint which generated the hit (caused voltage to cross
    threshold), including time offsets due to protons on target and muon
    decay.  The associated collection is in parallel with
    the StrawDigi collection, and there's a separate collection of the same
    objects in paralle with the StrawHits.  Reimplement the MC truth testing
    in ReadKalfits to use the StrawDigiMC.
