  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_4

1) October 11, 2013 brownd
   Change INA and OPA material to 5% borated polyethylene.  Introduce new
   parts of INA (3 and 4) to help reduce tracker backgrounds. By default,
   INA3 and INA4 are material 'DSVacuum' and so have no effect.

2) October 14, 2013 roehrken
   Added the support structure of the stopping target. The support structure is composed
   of wires connecting the target foils with the outer proton absorber.
   Added new parameters to geom_01.txt to control the support structure: 
        bool   stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure
        int    stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_number
        double stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_angleOffset
        double stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_radius
        string stoppingTarget.foilTarget_supportStructure_fillMaterial
   Default values set to the nominal case of 3 wires of 0.0381mm radius made out of tungsten for each foil,
   with first wire along y-direction.
