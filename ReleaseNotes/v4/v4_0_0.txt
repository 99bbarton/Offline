  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_0

10) June 18, 2013, mjlee
    Add outer proton absorber geometry. See Mu2eG4/test/protonAbsorber_conical.txt 
    for How to use.
    Default of PA geometry is non-modifiable, full length PA without outer
    part, which is the same as before. 
    Modified codes:
      MECOStyleProtonAbsorberGeom/inc/MECOStyleProtonAbsorber.hh
      MECOStyleProtonAbsorberGeom/src/MECOStyleProtonAbsorber.cc
      MECOStyleProtonAbsorberGeom/src/MECOStyleProtonAbsorberMaker.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/protonAbsorber_conical.txt 
     
9)  June 14, 2013, knoepfel
    Add checkForStale utility in ConfigTools, which checks
    if deprecated variables are being used in the .txt geometry
    files.  Implemented in (e.g.) InternalNeutronAbsorberMaker.cc.

8)  June 12, 2013, knoepfel
    Add ExternalNeutronAbsorber class to Offline.  Add to GeometryService.

7)  June 7, 2013, knoepfel
    Modify DS geometry to include coils, thermal shield, and coil
    support system.  Updated materials.  Missing end walls on thermal
    shield due to inconsistency in drawings.  Remove "Toy" prefix in
    names of DS volumes -- not dealing with toy DS geometry anymore.

6)  May 31, 2013, genser

    Added another draft version of a Shielding derived Geant4 Physics List Shielding_MU2E01
      Mu2eG4/inc/Shielding_MU2E01.hh
      Mu2eG4/inc/Shielding_MU2E01.icc
      Mu2eG4/src/physicsListDecider.cc

5)  May 31, 2013, gandr
    Preserve proper time of particles in multi-stage jobs that use the
    FromStepPointMCs generator.

4)  May 31, 2013, gandr
    Rename Target to StoppingTarget,  package TargetGeom to StoppingTargetGeom.

3)  May 31, 2013, gandr
    Define stopping target position in the Mu2e system, get rid of
    some of the 12000-s of the relic system.

2)  May 31, 2013, gandr
    Use the Mu2e coordinate system for PointTrajectoryCollection.

1)  May 31, 2013, gandr
    Use the Mu2e coordinate system for all EventGenerator outputs.
