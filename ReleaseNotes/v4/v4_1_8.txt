           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_1_8

1) April 14, 2014 --- knoepfel

   a) Improvements to ProtonPulseRandPDF class.  Explicit out-of-time
      class member is deprecated in favor of Eric Prebys's new AC
      dipole transmission function (ACdipoleTransmissionFunction_02.txt), 
      which now includes contributions over the entire muon cycle.

   b) Changed debuncher cycle from 1694 -> 1695 ns, to be consistent
      with docdb-2771.

   c) Also removed deprecated proton-pulse/AC-dipole tables to avoid
      confusion.
