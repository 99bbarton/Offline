    deprecated configurations:

    In preparation for redoing the hall footprint in G4, I have
    introduced a helper class that takes an (x,y) pair expressed as a
    string, where both x and y are given in ft/in, and converts them
    to a pair in metric (mm).  The interface is described in
    Mu2eUtilities/inc/CoordinateString.hh.

    New files:
       Mu2eUtilites/inc/CoordinateString.hh
       Mu2eUtilites/src/CoordinateString.cc
