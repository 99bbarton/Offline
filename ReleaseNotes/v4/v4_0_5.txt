           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_5

8) October 24, 2013 ehrlich
   Updated files in CosmicRayShieldGeom and Mu2eG4/src/constructCRV.cc
    inserted a G4Box for the CRV layers 
    to speed up the surface check

   Updated files in mucapture module:
     in preparation for Geant4 version 10 used 
     CLHEP/Units/SystemOfUnits.h or CLHEP/Units/PhysicalConstants.h
     and conditionaly used G4ExceptionDescription to remove 
     warnings about obsolete strstream

6) October 23, 2013 genser
   Changed the way Geant4 version is handled to prepare for version 10
      Mu2eG4/src/SConscript
      Mu2eG4/src/checkMSCmodel.cc
      mucapture/src/SConscript

5) October 22, 2013 genser
   SConstruct
   per Ron R et al adding more environment variables to be exported
   to make it work with the new scons/python

4) October 21, 2013 kutschke
   setup.sh
    - Add -B option
    - Use the + syntax on qualifiers

   Splines is built against the wrong version of cpp0x.
   We can probably live with this for now.

   The comparison operators for Ptr<T> have changed. These files had to
   be changed to work around:

     HitMakers/src/MakeExtMonUCITofHits_module.cc
     KalmanTests/src/KalFitMC.cc
     TrkPatRec/src/FlagBkgHits_module.cc


   A) Given:
   Ptr<T> p = ....;

   This no longer works:
   if ( p != 0 )

   Replace it with:

   if ( p )

   This fixes some unintended automatic conversions that produce incorrect
   behaviour if the pointee data product has been dropped from the event.

   B)
   There is an oversight that will be fixed in the next release.
   Operator != is missing for Ptr<T>.

   Given:
   Ptr<T> p, q;

   This fails:
   if ( p != q )

   Instead use:

   if ( !(p == q) )

   With the new version of art, all analyzer modules must pass the
   parameter set to a new c'tor of the base class:
   Foo::Foo( fhicl::ParameterSet const& pset){}

   Becomes:
   Foo::Foo( fhicl::ParameterSet const& pset)
     : EDAnalyzer(pset){}

1) October 21, 2013 kutschke
   Bumped the required version of art to v1_08_09.
     - setup.sh
