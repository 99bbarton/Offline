1) First version with a non-trival physics list.  It is just copied
   from the G4 novice example N02 so it undoubtedly needs tuning.
   The default behaviour is still the old one - just transportation
   in a pure solendoid field.  To select the new physics list, change
   the following variable in the geometry file:

   bool g4.fullPhysics = true;

   The affect files are:
    Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsList.hh         - the more complete physics list
    Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsList.cc  
    Mu2eG4/inc/MinimalPhysicsList.hh  - the old physics list.
    Mu2eG4/src/MinimalPhysicsList.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - select one of the two lists.
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - user interface to select one of the lists.
