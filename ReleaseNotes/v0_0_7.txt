1) First version with a non-trival physics list.  It is just copied
   from the G4 novice example N02 so it undoubtedly needs tuning.
   This new physics list is the default behaviour.  To disable it and
   go back to the old behaviour ( which will be useful for debugging
   geometry ), change the g4.fullPhysics line in the geometry file 
   to false:

   bool g4.fullPhysics = false;

   The affected files are:
    Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsList.hh         - the more complete physics list
    Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsList.cc  
    Mu2eG4/inc/MinimalPhysicsList.hh  - the old physics list.
    Mu2eG4/src/MinimalPhysicsList.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - select one of the two lists.
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - user interface to select one of the lists.

2) Create a user stacking action which has a method to kill low momentum
   secondaries produced in the earth overburdern.  We can extend this to
   make other tests at stacking time.  Please segegrate each of the tests
   we develop so that they can easily be moved to separate classes once
   we get several of them.
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - register it
    Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh      - code to implement t
    Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.cc
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - New parameter g4.doCosmicKiller.
