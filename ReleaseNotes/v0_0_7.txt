1) First version with a non-trival physics list.  It is just copied
   from the G4 novice example N02 so it undoubtedly needs tuning.
   This new physics list is the default behaviour.  To disable it and
   go back to the old behaviour ( which will be useful for debugging
   geometry ), change the g4.fullPhysics line in the geometry file 
   to false:

   bool g4.fullPhysics = false;

   The affected files are:
    Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsList.hh         - the more complete physics list
    Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsList.cc  
    Mu2eG4/inc/MinimalPhysicsList.hh  - the old physics list.
    Mu2eG4/src/MinimalPhysicsList.cc
    Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc           - select one of the two lists.
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt           - user interface to select one of the lists.
