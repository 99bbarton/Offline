    Remove CPU time from the standard printout so that it is easier to 
    diff the log files from the reference jobs.  In the print method,
    make the terminal newline optional.

    Previously this was a placeholder.  It now contains codes for all
    G4 processes defined for QGSP_BERT and for all actions that can be
    taken by SteppingAction.
      ToyDP/inc/StoppingCode.hh
      ToyDP/src/StoppingCode.cc


    New class to hold information about all of the physics processes
    known to G4 plus the mu2e specific reasons why SteppingAction 
    can stop a track.
       Mu2eG4/inc/PhysicsProcessInfo.hh  
       Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsProcessInfo.cc

    New classes that hold a record of Mu2e-specific actions taken
    by SteppingAction.  Used to pass information from SteppingAction
    to TrackingAction::PostUserTrackingAction
       Mu2eG4/inc/UserTrackInformation.hh  
       Mu2eG4/src/UserTrackInformation.cc

    In TrackingAction, use the above two classes to provide a real value 
    for the StoppingCode that is part of the SimParticle record.
      Mu2eG4/src/TrackingAction.cc 
      Mu2eG4/inc/TrackingAction.hh

     The code to drop particles by pdgId was moved from SteppingAction 
     to StackingAction. This means that particles dropped by PDGID no longer
     are added to the SimParticleCollection.  When a track is killed by 
     SteppingAction, that action is recorded in the UserTrackInfo object. 
     Refactored SteppingAction to move repeated code into a function.
       Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh 
       Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc

     Add a call to trackingAction::endRun.  This optionally produces printout
     from PhysicsProcessInfo to give the frequency with which StoppingCodes
     occur.
       Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc

    Small updates of the configuration files:

    1. Mu2eG4/test/beamline_01.py and beamline_02.py - standard event 
       generator is switched on by default.
    2. Mu2eG4/test/beamline_genconfig.txt - added new parameter targetFrame
    3. Changed the way how magnetic field maps are defined in 
       Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt
