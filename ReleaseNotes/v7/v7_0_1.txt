           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_0_1
	   This new series includes breaking changes for MDC2018

7) June 6, 2018 gandr

   - Per the discussion in today's meeting, added stageOffset()
     information to SimParticle, so that stage info necessary for
     physical volume lookups can be preserved during event mixing.

6) June 6, 2018 genser
   - added more control over stepers and their precision parameters
   - added isTrackKilledByFieldPropagator plus related changes
   - changed some Geant4 verbosity controls

5) May 21-25, 2018 brownd
   - updated scripts for stage4 production

4) May 25, 2018 gandr

   - Remove obsolete data members from SimParticle.

3) May 18-20, 2018 gandr

   - Updates to calorimeter digitization code.  In particular,
     CaloShowerStepROFromShowerStep must support multiple compressed
     shower collections in order to run on mixed events.

2) May 18, 2018 gandr

   - GenId cleanup: replace several GenId values for DIO with a single
     dioTail, to be used for signal-like high momentum tracks.

     Most of the "bulk hit" processes that are mixed into the "emtpy
     event" background frames, including the bulk DIO spectrum, use
     the StoppedParticleReactionGun generator ID.

1) May 30, 2018 kutschke
    - Removed StrawIndex
    - Lots of follow-on changes
    - See ./removeStrawIndex.txt for details
