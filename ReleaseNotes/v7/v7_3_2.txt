           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_3_2, under development

3) 2/18/19 rlc
   Change all TTracker to Tracker.  A user is most likely
   to be disrupted if they use personal geometry files that contain
   "ttracker" - these can be updated with:
   sed -i 's/ttracker/tracker/g' *.txt
   Also the names of geometry volumes change from "TTracker*"
   to "Tracker*".

2) 2/11/19 rlc
   clean up and re-organize several things in preparation
   for database-based alignment.  remove Alignment directory.
   Create GeneralUtilities HepTransform to hold alignments.

1) 2/11/19 rlc
   merge straw_conditions branch.  This creates Db and Proditions
   service, and make them required for straw reco and track fitting.
   The current default settings are still to take conditions
   from fcl, and not the database itself.
