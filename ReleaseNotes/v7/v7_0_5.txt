   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     Commented out the definition of PrimaryProtonGunN
     in the table EventGenerator.producers that defines the full set of
     generators.  The corresponding library is not present in this commit so it
     generates an error at job startup when running EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl.

   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
     - Remove the individual configuration of proton time map and muon time map.
       Instead use the definitions in the prolog CommonDigiSim.  This now
       brings in the EventWindowMarker module; it's absence was the cause of the
       original error.
