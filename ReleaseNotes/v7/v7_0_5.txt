    Consolidate and cleanup fcl in prepreation for primary particle and mixing production
    Rename HitMakers to CommonMC as that is now its purpose

   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     Commented out the definition of PrimaryProtonGunN
     in the table EventGenerator.producers that defines the full set of
     generators.  The corresponding library is not present in this commit so it
     generates an error at job startup when running EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl.

   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
     - Remove the individual configuration of proton time map and muon time map.
       Instead use the definitions in the prolog CommonDigiSim.  This now
       brings in the EventWindowMarker module; it's absence was the cause of the
       original error.

    Update straw digitization.  This includes:
    - refinements to deal with boundary conditions near the microbunch wrapping
    - introduction of the event window marker and its use in digitization
    - clock distribution jitter
    - random threshold variation within hardware expectations
    - resolution of most of the FIXMEs
