           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_1_3
	   still under development

x. branch muminus_eplus : P.Murat
  x.1 bug fix in RMC/RPC internal conversion generation
      Bob's fix to RMC event weight
  x.2 all spectra parameterized as arrays of (x,y) pairs have x's corresponding to the bin centers
  x.3 fix shape of the RPC photon energy spectrum - wrong plot has been digitized and fit
  x.4 fix use of uninitialized memory in CalPatRec/src/DeltaFinder_module.cc
  x.5 initialize TrkStrawHit::hitRms with a small number to avoid assert's when printing
  x.6 add configs for proton reco to TrackCaloMatching and CalPatRec prolog files

2. branch muminus_eplus : H. Song 1 October 2018
  2.1 TrackAnalysis module analyzes both negative and positive tracks as the default
  2.2 TrkParticle can be changed in TrkDiag/fcl/prolog.fcl
  2.3 TrackAnalysis now decides KalmanHitCollections for reconstruction and TrackCaloMatching using desired TrkParticle (previously electrons were hardcoded)
  2.4 TrkAnaDigis ntuple output has 2 directories with a trkana TTree each. (Analysis scripts will have to be updated)
  2.5 trkana TTree branch names were changed to generalize charge
  2.6 TrackCaloMatching is now done for both electrons and positrons
  2.7 TrkDiag/fcl/TrkAnaDigis.fcl and TrkDiag/fcl/TrkAnaDigisCRV.fcl were cleaned up and various renamings were moved to prologs
