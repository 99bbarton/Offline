   FoilParticleGenerator now has three different enum types.
   They identify the random generator algorithms for foil extraction,
   position extraction and time extraction. 
   Moreover each different random extraction has its own method, which
   is called in a case statement within the method "generatePositionAndTime". 
   The random algorithms to be used are required in the c'tor, now.
   Generators that use the FPG class have been adapted to the new
   syntax.
