   Switch SimParticleCollection to be a MapVector

     ToyDP/inc/SimParticleCollection.hh
       - redefine the type .

     Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc
       - Pass data product reference at the start of the event, not the end.

     Mu2eG4/inc/TrackingAction.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/TrackingAction.cc
       - Major rewrite.  No longer need a transient map.  Fill the data product
         directly during the course of the event.
       - Add consistency check that will be run at the end of the event
         if debugging is enabled.

     Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack.cc
       - A few syntax changes needed for the new type.

   ToyDP/inc/SimParticle.hh
     - Remove superfluous include

   If I want to create a data product of type mu2e::MapVector<T>
   I must add lines for std::pair<uint32_t,T> and std::map<uint32_t,T> to both:
      ToyDP/src/classes.h
      ToyDP/src/classes_def.xml
   for each concrete class T that might be added to the event.  This was done for
   T=SimParticle, in preparation for step 7.

   GeneralUtilities/inc/MapVector.hh
   The version committed today is the first properly working version.
   The three big changes were that swap was missing a template parameter in its argument list,
   that erase was missing a return statement and that one of the insert methods required a
   templated argument type:

   template <class InputIterator>
   iterator insert ( InputIterator position, const value_type& value ){

   Also fixed a lot of typos.

   GeneralUtilities/inc/MapVector.hh
   GeneralUtilities/test/testMapVector1.cc
     First versions.  Not yet working and not used by any code.

   Create printout to be used to check that the beamline behaviour is unchanged when it is
   supposed to be unchanged.  
    Mu2eG4/src/ReadVirtualDetector_plugin.cc
      - Add optional printout that can be enabled at run time.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_02.py 
      - New file. The same as beamline_01.py but with no graphics and with printout.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_02.py 
      - Default event generator is the G4BeamlineGenerator.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt
      - Since beamline_genconfig.txt defaults to G4BL input.  Make this default too.
      - Also change the settings for the particle gun.

   The data member _hallOriginInMu2e was incorrectly redefined in the method constructSteel.
   All that is needed is to use a local data member.
   The error was introduced when constructSteel was first created.  
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc

   FoilParticleGenerator now has three different enum types.
   They identify the random generator algorithms for foil extraction,
   position extraction and time extraction. 
   Moreover each different random extraction has its own method, which
   is called in a case statement within the method "generatePositionAndTime". 
   The random algorithms to be used are required in the c'tor, now.
   Generators that use the FPG class have been adapted to the new
   syntax.
