   Create printout to be used to check that the beamline behaviour is unchanged when it is
   supposed to be unchanged.  
    Mu2eG4/src/ReadVirtualDetector_plugin.cc
      - Add optional printout that can be enabled at run time.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_02.py 
      - New file. The same as beamline_01.py but with no graphics and with printout.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_02.py 
      - Default event generator is the G4BeamlineGenerator.
    Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.txt
      - Since beamline_genconfig.txt defaults to G4BL input.  Make this default too.
      - Also change the settings for the particle gun.

   The data member _hallOriginInMu2e was incorrectly redefined in the method constructSteel.
   All that is needed is to use a local data member.
   The error was introduced when constructSteel was first created.

   FoilParticleGenerator now has three different enum types.
   They identify the random generator algorithms for foil extraction,
   position extraction and time extraction. 
   Moreover each different random extraction has its own method, which
   is called in a case statement within the method "generatePositionAndTime". 
   The random algorithms to be used are required in the c'tor, now.
   Generators that use the FPG class have been adapted to the new
   syntax.
