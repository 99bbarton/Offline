     - Change default LTracker to v3 ( now that the octagon sides
       are bounded by trapezoids.  See ReleaseNotes/v0_0_12.txt item 1).
     - This change makes the code faster.  The bug with overlaps is
       now removed; v3 even correctly finds some straws that v1 missed!

   Mu2eG4/test/transportOnlyGeom.txt
     - no longer need to override default LTracker.
