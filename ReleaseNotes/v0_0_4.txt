1) Changes to Example01 and Example02.
   Make the loop in Example01 more friendly to novice
   C++ users.  Assorted pedagodical cleanup.  Greatly
   simplify Example02 using CLHEP and RandomUnitSphere.

2) Peter Shanahan's cleanups to PiCapture.

3) Add some new methods to existing classes:
    CrudeStrawHitCollection: add indexByStrawIndex
    Straw: add isNearestNeighbour

4) Add a first draft of a cluster class.  Still needs
   a lot of work.
     ToyDP/inc/ProtoStrawCluster.hh
     ToyDP/src/ProtoStrawCluster.cc

5) Add a class than can add hits to an existing cluster.
    HitMakers/inc/growCluster.hh
    HitMakers/src/growCluster.cc

6) Add a module to exercise the cluster classes.
    HitMakers/src/ClusterHackv00_plugin.cc

7) LTrackerGeom/inc/StrawIndex.hh
   Revised StrawIndex one more time.  I made the c'tor both public
   and explicit.  Making it explicit gives the type safety I want
   so it is safe to make it public.  With this change I no longer need
   the static fromInt method.  So that method has been removed.

8) The following had to be changed to use the revised StrawIndex class:
     - LTrackerGeom/src/LTrackerMaker.cc
     - LTrackerGeom/src/Straw.cc
     - ToyDP/inc/StepPointMC.hh
     - ToyDP/src/CrudeStrawHit.cc

9) ToyDP/inc/DPIndex.hh
   Changes to comments and formatting or output.  No functional changes.


9) Added new functions to:
     - LTrackerGeom/inc/CrudeStrawHitCollection.hh
     - LTrackerGeom/src/CrudeStrawHitCollection.cc
     - added methods operator [] and strawIndexToHitIndexOrThrow.

10) EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
      - bug fix.  tmin was improperly initialized from the
        config object.

11) Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
     - because of 10), I was setting the start time of
       all tracks to 0. 
     - it is now set correctly.

12) Mu2eG4/src/ReadBack_plugin.cc
    HitMakers/src/MakeCrudeStrawHit_plugin.cc
     - adjust range of the time histogram, in response to 10.

13) Mu2eG4/src/G4_plugin.cc 
    Mu2eG4/test/g4test_01.py 
    Mu2eG4/test/g4test_02.py 
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt 
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_02.txt 
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_03.txt
    Previously the name of the visualizaiton macro file was 
    defined in the geometry file.  It is now defined as
    an untracked parameter of the G4_plugin module, 
    passed in via the pSet mechanism.


14) ToyDP/inc/CrudeStrawHit.hh 
    ToyDP/src/CrudeStrawHit.cc 
    ToyDP/src/classes_def.xml 
    Mu2eUtilities/inc/resolveTransients.hh
    
    CrudeStrawHits now has two mutable data members that are not persisted;
    they are marked transient in the classes_def.xml file.  Their values can be
    recovered after readback using resolveTransients; this is a temporary
    solution that will not be necessary when we upgrade to a more modern version
    of root.

15) HitMakers/src/MCSH_Test_plugin.cc 
    HitMakers/test/makehits.py
    These were modified to take advantage of 14.

16) LTrackerGeom/inc/CrudeStrawHitCollection.hh 
    LTrackerGeom/src/CrudeStrawHitCollection.cc
    These were updated to deal with 14. They will soon be removed because I think that they
    are no longer necessary.
