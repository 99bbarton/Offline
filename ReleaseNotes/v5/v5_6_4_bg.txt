           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_4_bg

   This tag is an odd one.
   I branched from master at tag v5_6_4.
   The new branch is named v5_6_4_branch.

   I modified:
      Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt

   so that it includes:
      Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s4p2_backgroundSim.txt

   So on this branch the default geometry has all 20 planes in place.
   On the master branch the default is 18 planes.

   This allows us to run all of the 1,000,000 fcl files for stage 4
   that are already uploaded and which use geom_common.

   The modified head of the branch has been tagged v5_6_4_bg
