Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_3_4

1.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Code cleanup in several files in
    ExternalShieldingGeom package to remove some old debugging couts and to enable
    reading in several parameters as vectors instead of one value at a time.
    The latter will shrink the text description files and hopefully make them
    more readable.  Also removed the floor of the downstream endcap shielding per
    request from the CRV.

2.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Complete removal of old 
    ExternalNeutronShieldingGeom package and mentions thereof in Mu2e code.

3.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Add DS saddles. 

4.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 12 May 2015.  Change protonabsorber 
    material entirely to HDPE.
