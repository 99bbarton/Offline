Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_3_4

6) May 19, 2015 - ehrlich
   Updated the code in CRVResponse (bug fixes, faster simulation, better simulation of the
   Cerenkov photons). New lookupt tables are now in
   /mu2e/data/outstage/ehrlich/CRVLookupTables/LookupTable  


5) May 14, 2015 - youzy
   Add comments for pbar absorbers, remove a test piece of pbar absorber in TS2

1.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Code cleanup in several files in
    ExternalShieldingGeom package to remove some old debugging couts and to enable
    reading in several parameters as vectors instead of one value at a time.
    The latter will shrink the text description files and hopefully make them
    more readable.  Also removed the floor of the downstream endcap shielding per
    request from the CRV.

2.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Complete removal of old 
    ExternalNeutronShieldingGeom package and mentions thereof in Mu2e code.

3.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Add DS saddles. 

4.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 12 May 2015.  Change protonabsorber 
    material entirely to HDPE.

5.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 15,18 May 2015:  Change name of 
    InternalNeutronAbsorber4 to TSdA.  Make it HDPE.  Move it into 
    BeamlineGeom package.
    Remove all traces of InternalNeutronAbsorber package.  
    Add an external shielding piece to fill a gap at the DS endcap shielding
    interface.  Add rings to DS, put in basics of code for DS rails.
