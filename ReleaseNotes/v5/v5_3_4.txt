           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_3_4

7) May 23, 2015 - brownd
    Introduced new functionality to model fluctuations in the primary proton
    microbunch intensity.  There are 3 components:
      -ProtonBunchIntensitySimulator_module generates a single event object of type
      ProtonBunchIntensity, which records the # of protons for this particular
      microbunch, and the mean value of the distributrion from which this
      value was sampled.  Currently only 2 models are supported; a constant
      value of intensity, and a flat distribtion chacterized by a mean value
      and a width.
      -ProtonBunchIntensitySummarizer_module reads all the
      ProtonBunchIntensity objects in the event, makes sure they are
      consistent, and then summarizes them into an EventWeight object.  This
      object MUST be used as weight for any downstream analysis which depends
      on stopped muons (i.e. conversion electrons, DIO, ...) to get correct
      results.
      -2 Modifications to MixMCEvents.  The first is for when MixMCEvents is
      used to simulate mixing many individual events from several primary process
      background frames into the primary event, so that the the number of individual process
      background frame events mixed into the primary event scales with the
      number of protons.  This mode is used when running mixing inline with
      signals (very inefficient), or when creating pre-mixed complete
      background frame events.  This change requires interpreting the mean value
      given to this module configuration as the probability of producing a
      non-empty event from this process per incident proton.  The other change
      is for when MixMCEvents is used to mix the single pre-mixed background
      frame event into the primary event.  In that mode, each individual mixer
      module instance for each process will find the ProtonBunchIntensity
      object in the 2ndary event, and copy that into the primary event.  These
      are the ProtonBunchIntensity objects

   Updated the code in CRVResponse (bug fixes, faster simulation, better simulation of the
   Cerenkov photons). New lookupt tables are now in
   /mu2e/data/outstage/ehrlich/CRVLookupTables/LookupTable

1.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Code cleanup in several files in
    ExternalShieldingGeom package to remove some old debugging couts and to enable
    reading in several parameters as vectors instead of one value at a time.
    The latter will shrink the text description files and hopefully make them
    more readable.  Also removed the floor of the downstream endcap shielding per
    request from the CRV.

2.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Complete removal of old 
    ExternalNeutronShieldingGeom package and mentions thereof in Mu2e code.

3.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 6 May 2015.  Add DS saddles. 

4.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 12 May 2015.  Change protonabsorber 
    material entirely to HDPE.

5.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 15,18 May 2015:  Change name of 
    InternalNeutronAbsorber4 to TSdA.  Make it HDPE.  Move it into 
    BeamlineGeom package.
    Remove all traces of InternalNeutronAbsorber package.  
    Add an external shielding piece to fill a gap at the DS endcap shielding
    interface.  Add rings to DS, put in basics of code for DS rails.
    
6.  David Norvil Brown (Louisville), 26 May 2015:  Add DS Stand and saddle
    under calorimeter region.  Add plates on DS stand.  Add rails in DS.
