           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_1

4.  brownd 8 jan 2016
    Add straw materials to the Kalman filter track fit for straws which
    don't have hits, but which the trajectory indicates are traversed by the
    particle.  This improves the core momentum resolution and the tracking
    efficiency.

    Added BTrkHelper to the configuration of
      JobConfig/cd3/validation/stoppedMuonsSingleStage.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/transportOnly.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_01.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_02.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/surfaceCheck.fcl

    This is a stop gap measure to get the nighty tests working again.
    The longer term solution is to define table fragments for the sets of services
    needed for sim and reco.

2.  brownd  6 Jan 2016
    Further refactoring of the BTrk code.  The major change is the creation
    of an actual Mu2e DetectorModel (BaBar style offline geometry/material),
    and removing the previous hacks to get the KalmanFilter to work without
    this.  The changes that might be visible to users is that the
    TrkStrawHit moved from Mu2eBTrk to TrkReco (to avoid dependency loops),
    and moving the material-related classes (used in PID) from TrkStrawHit
    to DetTrkElem.  Internally, the material modeling of the straws used in
    the Kalman fit was consolidated and simplified, which reduces the size of
    the KalRep object, speeds the fitting, and slightly improves the fit
    results.  This update also provide all the structural changes needed to
    add materials from inefficient straws to the Kalman fit.

    Fix the length of the wires of the IPA support (version 2) recently
    introduced by Andy Edmonds.  This fix avoids an overlap issue but
    should be understood better.
