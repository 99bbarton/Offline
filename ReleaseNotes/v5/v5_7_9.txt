           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_9

1.  11 August 2016  dnbrow01
    Various geometry-related updates.
    i)  Scrubbed more unnecessary #includes per work done by Bryan Fagan.
    ii) Added pipes throughout, based on G4beamline files, which are not quite
        correct.  More work to be done here, but this gets pipes throughout
        active region.  Implementation by Bryan Fagan.
    iii) Added the mechanism to put holes in the MBS, without yet implementing.
    iv) Fixed angular coverage of the graphite collar insert in the Pbar 
    	absorber in TS1.
