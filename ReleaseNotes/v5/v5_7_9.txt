           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_9

2.  26 August 2016  ehrlich
    Changed the DYB cosmic event generator to allow user defined phi ranges
    for the generated cosmic ray muons. The phi range can be set in the 
    genconfig file. The event generator adjusts the cosmic rate accordingly.
    Example:
    string cosmicDYB.refPointChoice  = "Customized";
    string cosmicDYB.directionChoice = "Phi_Range";
    double cosmicDYB.muPhiMin = -1.570;
    double cosmicDYB.muPhiMax =  0;
    double cosmicDYB.dx     = 0;
    double cosmicDYB.dy     = 5000;
    double cosmicDYB.dz     = 5000;
    vector<double> cosmicDYB.cosmicReferencePointInMu2e = {-104,200,0};

    Various geometry-related updates.
    i)  Scrubbed more unnecessary #includes per work done by Bryan Fagan.
    ii) Added pipes throughout, based on G4beamline files, which are not quite
        correct.  More work to be done here, but this gets pipes throughout
        active region.  Implementation by Bryan Fagan.
    iii) Added the mechanism to put holes in the MBS, without yet implementing.
    iv) Fixed angular coverage of the graphite collar insert in the Pbar 
    	absorber in TS1.
