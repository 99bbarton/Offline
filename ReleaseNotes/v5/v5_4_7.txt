Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_7

   Replaced iron vacuum seal with 5 cm Mylar plug
   Added 1%, 3%, 5% borated concrete
   Seperated T-blocks around the stopping target from other type of blocks. Will allow to set different concrete materials in upstream and around the stopping target.

      There was on other fcl file that used @local::muonStops.  Now changed
      to  @local::mu2e.tgtMuonStops.

   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     StopMuonConversionGun and StoppedParticleReactionGun were still using
     @local::muonStops.  Switched to @local::mu2e.tgtMuonStops."
   This meant that they were still getting the tdr era stopped muon file,
   not the cd3 version.

   When I removed the user block from services, I forgot to update:

     services.user.SeedService.baseSeed         :  0
     services.user.SeedService.maxUniqueEngines :  20

   to

     services.SeedService.baseSeed         :  0
     services.SeedService.maxUniqueEngines :  20

  This is fixed in:
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_01.fcl
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_02.fcl
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
    Analyses/test/genMixReco.fcl
