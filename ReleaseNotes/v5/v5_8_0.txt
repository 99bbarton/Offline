Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_8_0

1)  dnbrow01  08 Sept 2016
    Added pump-out holes to MBS.  Add two new versions:  version 4 = version 2
    plus holes; version 5 = version 3 plus holes.  As a reminder, version 3
    included Anthony Palladino's parameter control for the beampipe cutout
    at the downstream end of the MBS.  Default version was 3, is now 5.
    Also updated the floor of the remote handling area by expanding the floor
    out to the walls, which were updated earlier this year.  Files touched:
