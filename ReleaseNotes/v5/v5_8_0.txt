Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_8_0

    Added pump-out holes to MBS.  Add two new versions:  version 4 = version 2
    plus holes; version 5 = version 3 plus holes.  As a reminder, version 3
    included Anthony Palladino's parameter control for the beampipe cutout
    at the downstream end of the MBS.  Default version was 3, is now 5.
    Also updated the floor of the remote handling area by expanding the floor
    out to the walls, which were updated earlier this year.  Files touched:

   Fixed a bug in the straw digi creation that was leaving us with two copies
   of the same straw hit for hits at early times, t < 100 ns. This does not 
   affect any of the CD3 simulations since we do not simulate any beam flash 
   with t < 500 ns. Files touched:
