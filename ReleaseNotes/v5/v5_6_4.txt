Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_4

3) Feb 01, 2016  dnbrow01
   Added version control to calorimeter crates.  To turn on building of 
   crates, one needs to add 
   int calorimeter.calorimeterCrateVersion = 2;  
   (or higher) to the calorimeterXXX.txt file being used.  If not present,
   default to crate version 1, which does not build crates.
   Added version = 2 flag to current calorimeter geom file, 
   calorimeter_BaF2.txt.  TDR-era geometry files should not choke on this.
