Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_7

     - The makeStation code made two copies of ipln1 rather than one
       copy each of ipln1 and ipln2.
     - The Station objects are never used in the construction of the G4
       representation: so the G4 simulations are OK.
     - We will investigate to learn if anyone relied on these.

2) Feb 12, 2015 brownd
   HitMakers/src/MakeStereoHits_module.cc
    - Define overlapping panel list by discovery, not as a data object.
    The only assumption made is that even and odd stations have reversed
    planes.
