     - In the previous version the TTracker mother touched the elements
       that it enclosed.  Now it has 100 microns of extra space.
     - This is needed to make the code for stopping particles on the TTracker
       mother work correctly.
     - Bertrand tells me that the Calo mother already has some extra space.
