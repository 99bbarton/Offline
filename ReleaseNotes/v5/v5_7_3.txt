Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_3

1)  02 April 2016   dnbrow01
    Update the RackElectronics Material with measurements from G. Drake
    et al. at ANL.  Add RackSteel material for this purpose.  Commit 
    the text file for description and placement of racks (first two
    in alcove downstream right).  Note that new electronic racks can
    be added purely via text file - no new code needed.  Code to build
    the racks committed.  The electronics rack text file now included
    from the latest geom_common_cd3 file.  Minor code fixes.
