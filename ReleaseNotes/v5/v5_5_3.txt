Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_5_3

11) Nov 18, 2015 brownd
    Disallow use of deprecated TrkPatRec_module (exception on construction)
    Provide tables and sequences for standard CD3 mixing in
    EventMixers/fcl/prolog.fcl
    Update CD3 mixing template to use tables and sequences
    Provide examples for tracking and mixing in TrkPatRec/test
    Remove obsolete example tracking scripts

    Split GlobalConstantsService/src/GlobalConstantsService_service.cc into two files:
       - GlobalConstantsService.cc
       - GlobalConstantsService_service.cc
    The first file contains the implementation of the class.
    The second file contains the plugin macros only.

    This was needed to break a link-time loop.  The file MassCache.cc, the line

    static ParticleDataTable const& pdt = *GlobalConstantsHandle<ParticleDataTable>();

    needs getElement<ParticleDataTable>, which is instantiated in the implementation
    of GlobalConstantsService.  This causes a link time loop between
    GlobalConstantsService.so and GlobalConstantsService_service.so

9) Nov 12, 2015 kutschke
   Clean up link lists for the main libraries but not for the
   _dict and _map libraries, if any:
      DataProducts/src/SConscript
      GeneralUtilities/src/SConscript
      ConfigTools/src/SConscript
      DataProducts/src/SConscript
      GeomPrimitives/src/SConscript
      GlobalConstantsService/src/SConscript

   This file did not need fixing:
      Mu2eInterfaces/src/SConscript

   RecoDataProducts/inc/StrawHitPosition.hh
   RecoDataProducts/src/StrawHitPosition.cc
     - Get rid of two static data members
     - Since a StrawHitFlag object is smaller than a pointer
       and it is not modified, it can be passed by value;
       also a default constructed BitMap object is just a
       zero initialized unsigned int - and the compiler will
       figure that out;so there is no run-time cost to the constructor
     - Relace the static constant invsqrt12 with a constexpr which is
       evaluated once at compile time.

   Last step in breaking link time loops (I hope).

   Created a new package to hold the definitions of "dumb" structs
   that will be part of the conditions system.  For now it has
   one file:
       ConditionsBase/inc/TrackerCalibrationStructs.hh
   which was moved from ConditionsService/inc/TrackerCalibrationStructs.hh

6) Nov 11, 2015 kutschke
   Moved the four ID objects (Device, Sector, Layer, Straw)
   from TrackerGeom to DataProducts.

5) Nov 10, 2015 kutschke
   Moved files from ConditionsService/data to GlobalConstantsService/data
       - mass_width_2008.mc
       - data/particle.tbl

   Mu2eG4/test/globalConstants_01.txt
     - Modified to find the above files in their new place.

4) Nov 10, 2015 kutschke
   Identified all packages that #include any file from
   the new GlobalConstantsService directory.  Added the new
   service to the link list for these pacakges.

3) Nov 10, 2015 kutschke
   In the full code base, updated all #include directives that
   include one of the header files moved in items 1 or 2.

2) Nov 10, 2015 kutschke
   - Created a new top level directory GlobalConstantsService
   - Moved everything related to GlobalConstantsService from
     the ConditionsService directory to the GlobalConstantsService
     directory.
   There are two reasons for this; ConditionsService was getting big
   and this organization makes dependencies clearer.

1) Nov 10, 2015 kutschke
   Move two classes from MCDataProducts to DataProducts.
    - VirtualDetectorId
    - PDGCode
   These two classes are used in the Geometry and GlobalConstants
   packages.  I prefer that those packages depend on a low level
   pacakge, ie DataProducts, and not on a higher level package such
   as MCDataProducts.
