   This code used to check each incoming PDGId to see if G4
   knew about that PDGId.  This happened when running stage
   2 and greater jobs, reading in ions, nuclei and excited
   nuclei created by G4 in an earlier stage.  Because G4
   creates particle table entries for these particles "on demand"
   and inside the hadronic physics code, they do not, in general
   exist in the particle table when a job starts, such as at
   the start of stage 2.

   Usually these particles had very low kinetic energy.  The
   hack fix was to replace the unknown particle with a proton with
   same kinetic energy.

   This behaviour caused a runtime dependence on G4.

   Since the creation of this hack, the G4 UserPrimaryGeneratorAction
   has been improved.  It now knows how to parse nuclei and ion ID
   codes and correctly sends them to G4.

   So the hack is no longer needed and has been removed.

     The code in the muoncapture subdirectory is not being built
     because it needs some maintenance. Therefore attempts to use
     it cause a link-time failure when closed links are enabled.
     Therefore I had to remove the option to use this code.

     If you try to use the unavailable code an exception will be
     thrown.
