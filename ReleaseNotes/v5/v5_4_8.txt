           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_8

   new 	   :   Analyses/test/vd_readStage2.fcl

   Several changes in ReadVirtualDetector module:
   - configuration variables, which describe input collection, are now 
     tags, which support the complex names (e.g. "g2run:DSVolume"). Before
     they were just the name of the collection.
   - added new configuration variable, "minMomentum", which allows to save
     only high energy particles in the ntuple. Default is -1 (no cut).
   - added example Analyses/test/vd_readStage2.fcl, which shows how to 
     read VD data from CD3 stage 2 simulation with this module
