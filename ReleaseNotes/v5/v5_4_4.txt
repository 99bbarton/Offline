           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_4

1) July 20, echenard

   - cleaned disk geometry - using a single logical volume for the crystals
   - Updated data product CaloHitSimPartMC to remove the dependance of
     StepPointMC, so they can be dropped from the data file


2)  David Norvil Brown (Louisville).  23 July 2015
    Modification to ExternalShieldingGeom/src/ExtShieldDownstreamMaker.cc
    by UofL student Kyle Steffen to read notch information from
    vector<double> instead of multiple doubles.  Makes ExtShieldDownstream
    geometry text file smaller and more readable.
    Modifications to Mu2eG4/geom/ExtShieldDownstream_v01.txt by DNB to take
    advantage of Kyle's mods and also to make external shielding more
    consistent with TeamCenter version - particularly barite vs. concrete
    near the Stopping Target.
    Added comments to Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/Mu2eBuildingMaker.cc and
    Mu2eG4/geom/mu2eBuilding.txt to indicate mu2eBuilding is deprecated
    and superceded by mu2eHall.  Will remove altogether in near future
    release.
