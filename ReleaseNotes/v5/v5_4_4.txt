Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_4

3) July 24, 2015 genser

    Disambiguated Foil_ TargetFoil_ and FoilSupportStructure logical volume
    names by basically doing: 
    std::ostringstream os; os << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << itf;
    foilInfo.name = "Foil_" + os.str();
    similarly for the physical ones; updated config parameter names using the current ones

      Mu2eG4/src/constructStoppingTarget.cc      - the core of the changes, also broken the very long lines
      Analyses/src/BkgRates_module.cc            - changed the handling of TargetFoil_
      Analyses/src/CEL_module.cc                 
      Analyses/src/RPC_module.cc                 
      Analyses/src/ReadStoppedPis_module.cc      
      Analyses/src/ReadVirtualDetector_module.cc 
      Analyses/src/StoppingTarget00_module.cc     
      Mu2eG4/geom/ProductionTargetInPS.txt       - added productionTarget.verbosity in comments
      Mu2eG4/test/transportOnlyGeom.txt          - removed obsolete config parameter names


2)  David Norvil Brown (Louisville).  23 July 2015
    Modification to ExternalShieldingGeom/src/ExtShieldDownstreamMaker.cc
    by UofL student Kyle Steffen to read notch information from
    vector<double> instead of multiple doubles.  Makes ExtShieldDownstream
    geometry text file smaller and more readable.
    Modifications to Mu2eG4/geom/ExtShieldDownstream_v01.txt by DNB to take
    advantage of Kyle's mods and also to make external shielding more
    consistent with TeamCenter version - particularly barite vs. concrete
    near the Stopping Target.
    Added comments to Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/Mu2eBuildingMaker.cc and
    Mu2eG4/geom/mu2eBuilding.txt to indicate mu2eBuilding is deprecated
    and superceded by mu2eHall.  Will remove altogether in near future
    release.

1) July 20, echenard

   - cleaned disk geometry - using a single logical volume for the crystals
   - Updated data product CaloHitSimPartMC to remove the dependance of
     StepPointMC, so they can be dropped from the data file
