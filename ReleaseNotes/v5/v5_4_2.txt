           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_2

2) July 11, 2015 gandr
    Changed the way to set up and build non-default configurations:
       - setup.sh will not accept any options
       - scons will not recognize the --mu2elevel and --mu2egs options
       - use Offline/buildopts to set the options (try ./buildopts --help)

    The supported buildopts are --build (prof or debug) and --g4vis
    (ogl, qt, none).  The options are sticky.  One must source setup.sh
    in a new shell after a build options change.
