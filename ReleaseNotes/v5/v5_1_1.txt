           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_1_1


2)  Oct 31, 2014 - genser

    Changed the interface to G4RunManager: Used its new (requested by
    Mu2e) API instead of inheriting from it. The change should
    decrease the need for potential future maintenance
    (also minimally modified timing printout)
