           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_5_7


1)  24 Nov 2015, dnbrow01
    Small modification to Mu2eG4/geom/ExtShieldDownstream_v02.txt to widen
    the DS right penetration to accommodate 14" pipes rather than 12".

2) 24 Nov 2015, logash
   
   Small update of Mu2eG4Cuts.cc: added new cut "globalTime" in ns. 
   If global (G4) time for a particular particle reaches this limit, the
   particle is killed. This cut is useful for simulation of trapped 
   particles.
