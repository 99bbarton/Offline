  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v3_0_1

3) March 20, 2013 kutschke
   Add debug level switch to the scons command line.
   There are two options:
        --mu2elevel=prof
        --mu2elevel=debug
   The default is prof for "profile build."  Others values can be added if
   desired but I want to keep these two having the same meanings that they
   have for art:

     prof   -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG
     debug: -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O0

   The profile build is intended to be used for production - it keeps enough debug symbols
   to get a traceback but not enough for full debugging.

   Removed setup_g4961.sh setup_g4952.sh
   They won't work with this build due to compiler version mismatch.
