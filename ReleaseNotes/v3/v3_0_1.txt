  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v3_0_1

17) March 29, 2013 gandr
    An arbitrary set of logical volumes can be made sensitive via fcl.
    
16) March 28, 2013 gandr
    Implement Rob's todo #3 in SensitiveDetectorHelper: make possible to
    selectively enable sensitive detectors via fcl configuration.
    
15) March 28, 2013 knoepfel
    InternalNeutronAbsorber geometry object added, plus corresponding
    constructInternalNeutronAbsorber.* files in Mu2eG4.  This serves
    mostly as a placeholder until the final int. neutron abs. design
    is settled upon.  The InternalNeutronAbsorber class assumes that
    the first section includes concentric annular cylinders, and the
    second section includes just one annular cylinder that extends to
    the Z-max of the DS.

    New:
     InternalNeutronAbsorberGeom/inc/InternalNeutronAbsorber.hh
     InternalNeutronAbsorberGeom/inc/InternalNeutronAbsorberMaker.hh
     InternalNeutronAbsorberGeom/src/InternalNeutronAbsorber.cc
     InternalNeutronAbsorberGeom/src/InternalNeutronAbsorberMaker.cc
     InternalNeutronAbsorberGeom/src/SConscript
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructInternalNeutronAbsorber.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/constructInternalNeutronAbsorber.cc
    Modified:
     Mu2eG4/src/constructNeutronAbsorber.cc

14) March 27, 2013 genser
    Explicitly added g4.minRangeCut to g4studyGeom.txt

13) March 27, 2013 knoepfel
    Added additional accessors to DetectorSolenoid to remove necessity
    for explicitly referencing G4Polycone type in the construct*.cc
    files.  Also removed references to Beamline geom. position in
    several files in favor of the DetectorSolenoid position()
    accessor (which is based off of Beamline).

    Modified files:
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/inc/DetectorSolenoid.hh
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/src/DetectorSolenoidMaker.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructDS.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructMBS.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructNeutronAbsorber.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc

12) March 26, 2013 kutschke
    Removed LTrackerGeom and all references to LTracker throughout the code base.

11) March 26, 2013 kutschke
    Removed the HitCluster class.  This was LTracker specific code that was used as a test bed for early
    ideas about data products.

10) March 26, 2013 kutschke
    Removed the directory HoughTransform and the HoughCircle data products in RecoDataProducts.
    These were relics from early efforts by Bob Bernstein in 2009 or so.

9) March 26, 2013 kutschke
   GeneralUtilities/inc/OwningPointerCollection.hh
   The copy c'tor and the copy assignment are back to being private and unimplemented in order
   to be compatible with genreflex.

8) March 26, 2013 genser

   Disabled muConversionAtRest by default (relates to g4.doMuMinusConversionAtRest)
     Mu2eG4/src/toggleProcesses.cc

7) March 26, 2013 knoepfel
   Address geometrical inconsistencies: DS z-length is now 10750 mm
   instead of 12000 mm, which was inconsistent with CDR specs.  Z-max
   of int. neutron absorber constrained to not exceed z-extent of DS.

   Modified files:
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/src/DetectorSolenoidMaker.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructNeutronAbsorber.cc
     Mu2eG4/test/DetectorSolenoid_v01.txt
     ReleaseNotes/v3/v3_0_1.txt

6) March 26, 2013 knoepfel
   Added new DS geometry class.  Modified geom_01.txt to include new file
   DetectorSolenoid_01.txt file.  As DS3 vacuum volume is now represented as
   a G4Polycone object instead of a subtraction solid, other files needed
   modification and are listed below.

   Note that a diff of constructProtonAbsorber.cc between this new version
   and the previous might show significant discrepancies between files---
   this is a red herring, as the tab-formatting was just adjusted in the new
   version...sorry about that.  Only the handling of ToyDS3Vacuum was modified
   in this file.

   New:
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/inc/DetectorSolenoid.hh
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/inc/DetectorSolenoidMaker.hh
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/src/DetectorSolenoid.cc

5) March 22, 2013 gandr
   More flexible configuration of debug printouts in ParticleGunImpl

4) March 20, 2013 kutschke
   In G4_module, look for a parameter set parameter
     physics.producers.g4run.postInitMacro : "filename.mac"
   if it does not exist, do nothing new.  If it does exists, treat the value of the
   parameter as a file name, find it in MU2E_SEARCH_PATH and then execute it as a G4 macro.
   Do this immediately before the call to _runManager->Initialize().
   This search path is the same one used ot resolve SimpleConfig files.

3) March 20, 2013 kutschke
   Add debug level switch to the scons command line.
   There are two options:
        --mu2elevel=prof
        --mu2elevel=debug
   The default is prof for "profile build."  Others values can be added if
   desired but I want to keep these two having the same meanings that they
   have for art:

     prof   -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG
     debug: -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O0

   The profile build is intended to be used for production - it keeps enough debug symbols
   to get a traceback but not enough for full debugging.

2) March 19, 2013 kutschke
   Removed setup_g4961.sh setup_g4952.sh
   They won't work with this build due to compiler version mismatch.

1) March 19, 2013 gandr
   New MBSGeom accessors to cleanup DS vacua definitions.
