  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v3_0_1

   In G4_module, look for a parameter set parameter
     physics.producers.g4run.postInitMacro : "filename.mac"
   if it does not exist, do nothing new.  If it does exists, treat the value of the
   parameter as a file name, find it in FHICL_FILE_PATH and then execute it as a G4 macro.
   Do this immediately before the call to _runManager->Initialize().

   Add debug level switch to the scons command line.
   There are two options:
        --mu2elevel=prof
        --mu2elevel=debug
   The default is prof for "profile build."  Others values can be added if
   desired but I want to keep these two having the same meanings that they
   have for art:

     prof   -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG
     debug: -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O0

   The profile build is intended to be used for production - it keeps enough debug symbols
   to get a traceback but not enough for full debugging.

   Removed setup_g4961.sh setup_g4952.sh
   They won't work with this build due to compiler version mismatch.

   New MBSGeom accessors to cleanup DS vacua definitions.
