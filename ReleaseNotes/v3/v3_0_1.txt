  Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v3_0_1

6) March 26, 2013 knoepfel
   Added new DS geometry class.  Modified geom_01.txt to include new file
   DetectorSolenoid_01.txt file.  As DS3 vacuum volume is now represented as
   a G4Polycone object instead of a subtraction solid, other files needed 
   modification and are listed below.
   
   Note that a diff of constructProtonAbsorber.cc between this new version
   and the previous might show significant discrepancies between files---
   this is a red herring, as the tab-formatting was just adjusted in the new
   version...sorry about that.  Only the handling of ToyDS3Vacuum was modified
   in this file.
   
   New:
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/inc/DetectorSolenoid.hh
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/inc/DetectorSolenoidMaker.hh
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/src/DetectorSolenoid.cc
     DetectorSolenoidGeom/src/DetectorSolenoidMaker.hh

   More flexible configuration of debug printouts in ParticleGunImpl

   In G4_module, look for a parameter set parameter
     physics.producers.g4run.postInitMacro : "filename.mac"
   if it does not exist, do nothing new.  If it does exists, treat the value of the
   parameter as a file name, find it in MU2E_SEARCH_PATH and then execute it as a G4 macro.
   Do this immediately before the call to _runManager->Initialize().
   This search path is the same one used ot resolve SimpleConfig files.

   Add debug level switch to the scons command line.
   There are two options:
        --mu2elevel=prof
        --mu2elevel=debug
   The default is prof for "profile build."  Others values can be added if
   desired but I want to keep these two having the same meanings that they
   have for art:

     prof   -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG
     debug: -std=c++11 -rdynamic -Wall -fPIC -g -O0

   The profile build is intended to be used for production - it keeps enough debug symbols
   to get a traceback but not enough for full debugging.

   Removed setup_g4961.sh setup_g4952.sh
   They won't work with this build due to compiler version mismatch.

   New MBSGeom accessors to cleanup DS vacua definitions.
