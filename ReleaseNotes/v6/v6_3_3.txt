Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_3_3

1)    dnbrow01  29 September 2017
        Polycone class definition had apparently originally been designed
	to hold all the information necessary to describe it as indiviual
	data elements.  Later is was migrated to hold the same information
	in a single PolyconsParams object.  But the original, now unused,
	data elements were still being carried around.  They are now 
	deleted.      
	modified:   GeomPrimitives/inc/Polycone.hh 


	Created an OPA version number.  Version number 1 builds the OPA
	as done in the past - as a conical frustrum.  Version 2 builds it
	as a "barrel" of slats.  The shape is called a G4Polyhedra in GEANT4
	(yes, they use the plural even for one).  We create a corresponding
	shape representation in Mu2e code, independent of G4.  Since 
	G4Polyhedra have been rare in our code to date, made some new 
	utility functions to help with inserting them into our Geometry
	model, now that they are being used more prominently in Mu2e.

	Fix the shape and fill the gaps in the Cable runs.  Add four service 
	pipes along the bottom of the DS.

	Better center the pipe in the hole through the External Shielding.

	Put the insulating vacuum in the TS cryostat sections.  The code
	changes were extensive, so did not version this - affects all 
	versions of the TS.  Should have no affect on any sensitive volumes,
	reconstruction, etc.

	coordinate systems (Mu2e<-->Detector), (Mu2e<-->G4Bl), 
	(Detector<-->G4Bl) for now.

	code for now and should not be until given a green light.

	Alignment in Mu2e.  Not yet included in any build.

	We have Mu2eG4 for Geant4-based Mu2e geometry info and standalone
	test executable.  Mu2eReco could play a similar role for the
	reco-only geometry service.  Does not affect any other code currently
