1) bownd, 10 Mar 2018.  Merge triggerDev branch with master, which includes major
   changes to the track hit reconstruction and pattern recognition.  StrawHitPosition,
   StereoHit, HelixHit and several other data products are replaced by ComboHit. Other
   data products are modified to use Root cartesian vectors instead of Hep3Vector,
   replace doubles with floats, etc. A module combining hits in the same panel is added
   to the hit reco sequence.  The trigger sequence now uses separate module instances and
   configurations from standard (diagnostic) reconstruction.
