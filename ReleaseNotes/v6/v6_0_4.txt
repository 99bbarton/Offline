Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_0_4

1) brownd 13 Dec 2016
  Merge development branch 'trktime' in with master.  This includes >100 individual commands and >100 individual
  file changes.  These changes are mostly structural in the track reconstruction, providing more granular reconstruction,
  better separation of reconstruction and diagnostics, improved data products, and improved diagnostics.  Some algorithms
  have changed, notably those where bugs were found in the unupdated version.  There is also some consolidation and
  simplification of redundant existing code and data products.  Data product secondary keys have been removed and module
  instance labels in tracking simplified and standardized.  These changes should be transparent to users using
  the tracking fcl sequences, but they do change the TTree directories of diagnostics output and so analysis macros
  may need revision.
