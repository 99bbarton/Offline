Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_0_4
6) dnbrow01  11 Jan 2017
   Added end plates/rings for new HRS design, not yet included in 
   geometry by default (not ready for prime time).


5) Echenard, 9 Jan 2017
   Added TriggerInfo data product classes
   Added CaloCrate sensitive detector

4) dnbrow01  07 Jan 2017
   Updated t0 cut definitions for RPC background cutAndCount studies.
   Updated this release note (first *documented* update of the year!)

3) dnbrow01  07 Jan 2017
   Updated design of the HRS to match latest drawings in Docdb 3926.
   Added proper bronze material (had used G4_Cu).  New version of the
   HRS is not actually used yet, as endcap rings/plates are needed.
   Geometry for now still points to PSShield_v05.txt.

1) brownd 13 Dec 2016
  Merge development branch 'trktime' in with master.  This includes >100 individual commands and >100 individual
  file changes.  These changes are mostly structural in the track reconstruction, providing more granular reconstruction,
  better separation of reconstruction and diagnostics, improved data products, and improved diagnostics.  Some algorithms
  have changed, notably those where bugs were found in the unupdated version.  There is also some consolidation and
  simplification of redundant existing code and data products.  Data product secondary keys have been removed and module
  instance labels in tracking simplified and standardized.  These changes should be transparent to users using
  the tracking fcl sequences, but they do change the TTree directories of diagnostics output and so analysis macros
  may need revision.
