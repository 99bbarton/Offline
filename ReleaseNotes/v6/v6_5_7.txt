  merge triggerDev branch: this includes:
  -TrkStrawHit now references ComboHit instead of StrawHit class objects.  This reduces
  data duplication and improves trigger processing time.
  - Knock-on changes to some reco-level persistent classes
  - Change straw hit signal propagation time to use calibrated propagation velocity
  - straw-in-panel calibration parameters for t0, gain
  - panel t0 offsets
