           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_4

2) TrkDiag/test/ce.C
   Update the module label used as a TDirectory name to match the
   new conventions.


1) Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_current.txt
   The code does not respect the indended difference between the z0 of
   tracker center and the z0 of the origin of the detector system.  So
   these two items must have the same value.  Specfically, in
   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_current.txt the line:

     double mu2e.detectorSystemZ0 = 10171.;

   must match:

    double ttracker.z0 = 10171.0;

   from the included ttracker file.  For now this must be maintened by hand.

   The intention is that ttracker.z0 describes the nominal center of the ttracker
   whereas mu2e.detectorSystemZ0 describes the origin of a coordinate system in
   which the reco work is done.  When we do alignment on the tracker, its position
   and orientation can shift but the detector system should stay fixed. This
   distinction is not respected by the code so, for the time being, the two values
   must be the same.

   This changed fixes an problem introduced with commit d8b1d154 on June 6, 2017.
