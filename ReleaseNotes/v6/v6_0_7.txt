Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_0_7

6) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Remove tbb from ups packages we setup.  It was needed temporarily
   because of an oversight in the art table file - that has since been fixed.

5) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   bin/satelliteFuncs
     - Add setting of ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH to the setup.sh in a satellite release.

4) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Renamed bin/genreflex.sh to bin/mu2e_genreflex
     - this is script is executed, not sourced - so no .sh
     - the base name is more accurate
   Modify SConstruct to use mu2e_genreflex
     - Remove the hard coded path to mu2e_genreflex and
       let the command be resolved from $PATH.

3) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Add support for copying a build of Offline into a ups product.
   All files are in the ups_install directory.
   Later in the day change the ups product name from "Offline" to "offline".

2) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Add support for building a release for use in the trigger.
     - Do not setup G4 and do not build any code that requires G4
     - Do not build Sandbox (keep HelloWorld for debugging)

   buildopts  - add a new option: --triggerStrip
   setup.sh   - do not setup geant4 if --triggerStrip is asserted
   SConstruct - remove selected SConscript files from the build.

    Add the above-ground walls to the Mu2e building.  Update the PS Cryostat,
    crucially modifying Al->Stainless Steel and correcting the inner radius.
