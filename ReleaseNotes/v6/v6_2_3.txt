Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_3

4)  dnbrow01  20 June 2017
    Simplify the constructions of cryostat saddles and stands.  Improves 
    heirarchy and reduces the number of geometric pieces needed to describe
    items.  Not in default geometry, added via geom_common_current.txt

    Added an Option for an inner lining on the DS cryostat (inner in the 
    sense of being on axis side of the inner cryostat shell - toward the
    detectors).  This is by request for studying shielding.
    It is turned on and off by a single parameter:
    bool ds.hasInnerLining = false;  
    False is the default value and should only be changed by persons
    deliberately testing this lining.

    Cleaned out some code that hasn't actually been used in ages.

    Separate saddle/stand construction from external shielding
    construction.  Prepare the code for a move to a better hierarchy
    for the saddles/stands.  Make a new Saddle_cd3a.txt file which
    (a) incorporates mods from UofL student Dustin Cox to update
    the description of stands in the PS to most recent drawings and
    (b) make saddles with curved edges rather than polygonal
    approximations.

    Put the IFB end window at the actual end of the IFB vacuum region.

    Add an option for selective surface checking on saddles/stands

  Merge HitFilter branch with master: this includes refactoring of the LowE electron tracker hit filter
  module FlagBkgHits, with associated changes to data products, diagnostics, and algorithms.  The most
  important changes are:
  - Consistent use of 'bkg' to designate background objects and functions (replaces inaccurate 'delta')
  - Abstract interface to hit clustering
  - Relocation of relevant modules to TrkFilters and algorithms to TrkReco packages
  - Introduction of data products to record background clusters and classification
  - Removal of MC dependence and diagnostics from modules run in the trigger (M. Pettee)
  - Modernization and simplification of code and algorithms
  - Reduced memory thrashing and improved convergence in two-level-threshold (TLT) clustering algorithm
  These changes affect several packages (notably CalPatRec) through changes in include files, but no functional
  changes are expected there.  Functional changes in the track reconstruction sequence involve improved
  background filtering and reduced compuational time.
