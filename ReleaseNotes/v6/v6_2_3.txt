Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_3

1) brownd 8 June 2017
  Merge HitFilter branch with master: this includes refactoring of the LowE electron tracker hit filter
  module FlagBkgHits, with associated changes to data products, diagnostics, and algorithms.  The most
  important changes are:
  - Consistent use of 'bkg' to designate background objects and functions (replaces inaccurate 'delta')
  - Abstract interface to hit clustering
  - Relocation of relevant modules to TrkFilters and algorithms to TrkReco packages
  - Introduction of data products to record background clusters and classification
  - Removal of MC dependence and diagnostics from modules run in the trigger (M. Pettee)
  - Modernization and simplification of code and algorithms
  - Reduced memory thrashing and improved convergence in two-level-threshold (TLT) clustering algorithm
  These changes affect several packages (notably CalPatRec) through changes in include files, but no functional
  changes are expected there.  Functional changes in the track reconstruction sequence involve improved
  background filtering and reduced compuational time.
