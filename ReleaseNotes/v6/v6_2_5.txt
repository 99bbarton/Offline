Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_5

3) gandr 26 July 2017

   Removed 14 files, more than 3000 lines of obsolete code in Mu2eG4.

    Many changes to make the code compatible with gcc v6.3.0 -std=c++14.
    There should be no changes to executable behaviour and I have not seen
    any in my tests.  The next upgrade to a new art will require this compiler.

    Most of the changes arise because the new compiler is pickier than the old one.
    A) Some compiler headers that were not explicitly #included in our code were
       accidentally included by other compiler headers. Some of these now need to
       be explcitly included they are no longer accidentally included.

    B) Some automatic type conversions no longer work - fix by making them explicit.

    C) Many files have a misleading indentation warning
       - Usually fixed by adding {} in the right place or by changing indentation,
       - My judgement is that there were no real errors in the code.
       - The affected files are:
        CaloMC/src/CaloPulseShape.cc
        CaloReco/src/CaloRecoDigiFromDigi_module.cc
        CalorimeterGeom/src/SquareMapper.cc
        CalorimeterGeom/src/SquareShiftMapper.cc
        GeometryService/src/GeometryService_service.cc
        TrkChargeReco/src/ComboPeakFitRoot.cc

    D) RecoDataProducts/inc/HelixHit.hh
         - The variable _hqual was not initialized by the second c'tor; initialize it to 0.

    E) Analyses/src/ReadCaloDigi_module.cc
         - Initialize an uninitialized variable - need to do a code review on this code.
           It should throw an exception rather than dereference an 0 pointer.

    F) New directory: boost_fix/. This contains header files named after boost
       headers.  In each case the file #includes the corresponding boost header
       and wraps it in pragmas that disable certain warnings just for that header.
       The reason is that the boost headers contain code that triggers compiler
       warnings - as best we can tell the code is correct.  This is our way to
       disable the checks only in the smallest possible scope.
       For this release the pragmas have been commented out - when we move to
       gcc 6.3.0 we will uncomment them.

    G) Many files: replace #include of native boost header with the one from boost_fix.
       When boost is fixed, we can find these later by acking the code base for boost_fix.

    H) Missing link library (one link now needs tbb that did not before).

    Commit work done by UofL student Lacee Pyles.  She has removed redundant
    vertices from a number of files used to specify building and dirt
    volumes.  The building and dirt are specified as extruded solids, 
    which means they are shapes specified on a plane as a series of
    vertices and then extruded from the plane.  It turns out some of our
    shapes had redundant vertices - series of three consecutive vertices
    with the same x- or y- coordinates.  In such cases, the middle vertex
    is unneeded.  Krzysztof pointed out to us that such extraneous 
    vertices could be flagged as an error in upcoming versions of GEANT4,
    so Lacee fixed these.  These changes do not affect the actual volumes.
