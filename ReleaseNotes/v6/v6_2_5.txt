Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_5

1)  dnbrow01  20 July 2017
    Commit work done by UofL student Lacee Pyles.  She has removed redundant
    vertices from a number of files used to specify building and dirt
    volumes.  The building and dirt are specified as extruded solids, 
    which means they are shapes specified on a plane as a series of
    vertices and then extruded from the plane.  It turns out some of our
    shapes had redundant vertices - series of three consecutive vertices
    with the same x- or y- coordinates.  In such cases, the middle vertex
    is unneeded.  Krzysztof pointed out to us that such extraneous 
    vertices could be flagged as an error in upcoming versions of GEANT4,
    so Lacee fixed these.  These changes do not affect the actual volumes.
