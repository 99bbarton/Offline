Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_4_0

4)      dnbrow01  12 November 2017
	Improve	  memory footprint by reusing sets of straws among panels.
	Rationalize some function and object naming.  Prepare for use
	of Alignment in	 G4 stage of simulation.

	Created a new version of the TTracker geometry that builds individual
	panels as they will be built instead of a bunch of copies of an
	idealized plane with copies of an identical plane of straws.  Here,
	each panel is built individually, and each straw within.  Will 
 	change back to identical bunches of straws in otherwise individually
	built panels to not hog so much memory.  Wanted to commit this
	so we have it.  The new version of the TTracker will not yet be
	seen by anybody unless they go well out of their way to use it.

      Updated a number of fcl files using StrawHit access that was outdated
      as of this release.  See item (1) below.

1)    brownd, rbonventre  30 October 2017
Major upgrade to the StrawHit response model and simulation, including:
- refined cluster formation simulation for MIP particles
- electronics response model using transfer functions
- added data driven attenuation and dispersion model
- updated tuning of electronics parameters
- TimeOverThreshold (TOT) measurement in StrawDigi and downstream
- require coincidence between straw ends to create a digi as in FPGA
- Update StrawDigi and downstream interfaces to treat measurements at
each end of the straw the same
- use hardware names for the straw ends (cal, HV)
- remove MC diagnostics in MakeStrawHits module
