Major upgrade to the StrawHit response model and simulation, including:
- refined cluster formation simulation for MIP particles
- electronics response model using transfer functions
- added data driven attenuation and dispersion model
- updated tuning of electronics parameters
- TimeOverThreshold (TOT) measurement in StrawDigi and downstream
- require coincidence between straw ends to create a digi as in FPGA
- Update StrawDigi and downstream interfaces to treat measurements at
each end of the straw the same
- use hardware names for the straw ends (cal, HV)
- remove MC diagnostics in MakeStrawHits module
