4) dbrown 28 April 2017
     Added more updates to the Offline Geometry.  

     i.  Added rough model of downstream cable run for the tracker.

3) dbrown 28 April 2017
    Made numerous changes to bring aspects of the Offline Geometry model
    up to date with current designs or plans for various components.

    i.  Updated model for TS3u/d interface region.  Added some structure
        representing flanges, vacuum end plates, pbar window support.

    iii.Made a working version of a reduced overlap checker.  Modify 
        Mu2eG4/test/geom_SurfaceCheck_Select.txt to pick the items you
        wish to check.  Then mu2e -c Mu2eG4/fcl/surfaceCheckSelect.fcl
        to run it.  Did require minor changes to a couple of construction
        code files to make it work right.

    iv. Added some pipes, finished the internal structure of some existing
        pipes.

    v.  Housekeeping, announced earlier in mu2e-hn-Geometry HN.

    vi. Updated 'master' geometry file with changes above.  Did not make
        this the default master geometry file yet, due to concern raised
	by Rob K.

2) brownd 21 April 2017
  Implemented stereo position correction for helix hits, plus some minor cleanup.

1) brownd 17 April 2017
   Added scripts for reading, writing, and analyzing digi files for processing in track trigger studies.
