   Merge triggerDev.  This includes minor changes to the track-only trigger.
   Migrate StrawHit to use StrawId instead of StrawIndex; this changes the
   persistent form of StrawHit and required substantial changes to downstream
   reconstruction and diagnostic code.  StepPointMC is now the only major 
   code that uses StrawIndex.
   Add a 'Legacy' package to store code that is no longer used or built but might be
   useful in the future.

   Added nonlinear drift velocity implemented in StrawDrift object, including phi dependent lorentz effects.
   Can be enable in simulation and in track reconstruction separately.  Default is off (linear drift).
