   Changed default thickness of pbar absorber to 360 mkm (geom_01.txt)

   Updated ReadVirtualDetector_plugin.cc: 
    - allowed for up to 20 virtual detectors
    - added option saveStopped to save in the particles ntuple 
      only stopped particles
    - added option requireVD to save in the particles ntuple 
      only those particles, which cross particular virtual detector

   FoilParticleGenerator now take into account also particles whose generation time
   is beyond the 1694 ns of the microbunch. It includes 3 cycles after the nominal one,
   subtracting the 1964 to the original generation time, in order to simulate
   the effects of the particles whose primary proton comes from the previous microbunch.
