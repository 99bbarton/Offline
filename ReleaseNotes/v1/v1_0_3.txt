   The code that depends on the BaBar code, currently only KalmanTests, is
   only built if the BaBar code is present.  SConstruct was modified to test 
   for the presence of the BaBar code and, if it is absent, to remove 
   KalmanTest/src/SConscript from the build list.

   KalmanTest/src/SConscript now exists and SConscript.sav is gone

   Modified KalmanTests package to work with art.
   Added a cint script to test make plots.
   SConscript is still disabled.

   Complete replacement for KalmanTests.  This now runs a development snapshot
   of how to use the BaBar Kalman filter.  This version works with the old
   framework: setupmu2e-v1.sh

   SConscript is still renamed to SConscript.sav so that it will not build by default.

   Add code to test art::Ptr.
       Analyses/src/PtrTest0_module.cc
       Analyses/test/ptrTeset0.fcl
   ( One of the commits included features that only work with art v00_07_09.
     Had to back these out until that version of art is generally available. )
