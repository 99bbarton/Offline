  1. Added posibility to specify gradient field in DS2.
     The value of gradient is set in the geometry file: 
       double toyDS.gradient      = 0.0; // Tesla/m
     It is only applied if detSolFieldForm is 1 or 2.

  2. Added posibility to kill particles if global time 
     reaches maximum allowed time which is set in the 
     geometry file:
       double g4.steppingActionMaxGlobalTime = 0; //ns
     Particles are killed in SteppingAction.

  3. Extended ProcessCode enum to add code for particles
     killed by time.

  4. Added "time virtual detector" in SteppingAction: position
     and momentum of all particles are recorded at global times, 
     specified in the geometry file:
       vector<double> g4.steppingActionTimeVD = { 500, 700, 1000 }; //ns
     This information is stored in yet another StepPointMC collection,
     named "timeVD".

  5. ReadVirtualDetector_module reads "timeVD" collection and creates 
     output ntuple, similar to virtual detector ntuple.

  6. Added option to ReadVirtualDetector_module to allow to save in
     the particles ntuple only those particles, which alive at particular
     global time (set with module parameter timeCut).

  7. Updated tool Mu2eG4/test/makeGeneratorFile.py to create input file 
     for generator using data from virtual detectors: 
       - added ability to read many input files
       - added ability to generate weight for input files, where 
         decays were switched off
       - added more help info

  8. Updated standard geometry file: removed vertical rotation of the 
     proton target. All recent simulations were done with the target 
     rotated only horizontally.
