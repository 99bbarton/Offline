 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_3

6) November 3, 2011 kutschke
   G4Helper now has a link time dependence on the geometry service.
   This was introduced in item 3 or 4.  Add this to the SConstruct.

   -added PointTrajectories to SimParticles which were not produced by "g4run" modules

4) November 3, 2011 gandr

   - VolumeInfo does not need to depend on Mu2eWorld for initialization.

3) November 2, 2011 gandr

   - Get rid of some static members and reduce coupling between
     classes: sensitive detectors can initialize themselves instead of
     relying on Mu2eWorld.

   - Remove public access to mu2eOriginInWorld from VolumeInfo.  The
     authoritative public source is geometry svc.

   - Move pieces of G4-specific geometry info from Mu2eWorld into an
     new geometry svc class WorldG4.

   - Remove PrimaryProtonGun parameters from Mu2eWorld and provide
     access to equivalent info through the new ProductionTarget
     geometry object.

   - Get rid of the WorldInfo class.

   -removed unused variables

     - Moved to art v1_00_02 to get past the error reading back default
       constructed art::Ptr<T>.
