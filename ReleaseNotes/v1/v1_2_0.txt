 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_2_0


6) June 21, 2012 logash

   Few changes, made for the simulation of trapped particles. Don't affect
   other studies.

   - Analyses/src/ReadVirtualDetector_module.cc

   New module option "addProperTime" (default: false). If true, the proper
   time, saved in the particles ntuple, is calculated as the sum proper 
   time of similar particles in the decay chain. This is needed for studies, 
   when pion decay is switched off.

   Small bug fixed: "isvd" is the particles ntuples is now declared as 
   bool, not float.

   - Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc   
   - Mu2eG4/inc/StackingAction.hh

   New geometry parameter g4.minPitch (default: 0), handled by StackingAction.
   It allows to drop all particles with sin(Theta) (pt/p) less than 
   specified value. This cut is useful for simulation of trapped particles.
    
   - Mu2eG4/test/makeGeneratorFile.py

   This utility, which generated input file for the event generator from the 
   data, saved in the vitrual detectors trees, was completely rewritten, and 
   it now gets data from particles tree (ntpart), rather than from virtual 
   detectors ntuple (ntvd).

     - Formatting changes

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
     - Follow-on from above.

4) June 19, 2012 gandr

   Tweak ExtMonFNAL filter channel definition to reduce acceptance loss due to multiple scattering.

3) June 15, 2012 gandr

   Make sure the overhead dirt above ExtMonFNAL does not end abruptly
   at the edge of the ceiling.

2) June 14, 2012 brownd
  Change default configuration of TrkPatRec to apply improved hit ambiguity
  resolution algorithm and simulated annealing.
  Change default time division resolution to correspond to recent
  measurements, see conditions_01.txt for details.

1) June 14, 2012 gandr

   Introduce a new geometry class Mu2eEnvelope.  Simplify WorldG4Maker.
