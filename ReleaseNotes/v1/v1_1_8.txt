 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_8

    - Fix error when calculating straw wall material when DOCA is larger than
    the straw radius.  Calculate the electronics propagation time error using
    the POCA instead of time division.  These fixes improve the efficiency of the
    Kalman fit by ~15%, and improve the resolution.  Add diagnostics.
    KalmanTests/KalFit,TrkStrawHit,KalFitMC.
    - Remove vestigal 'calorimeter t0' from StrawHitMC.

   In the creation of the straw hits, add the correction for the flight time
   from the start of the StepPointMC to POCA.

   A new small helper class that will be used in 2), above.

     ConditionsService/src/MassCache.cc
   In 2), we need, in the middle of a nested loop, to look up information
   in the particle data table. This class implements a caching layer to speed
   up this access.
