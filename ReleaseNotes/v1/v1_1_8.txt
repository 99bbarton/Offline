 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_8

8) March 29, 2012 kutschke
   MCDataProducts/inc/PDGCode.hh
   Added the enum value:
    G4Threshold = 999999999,

   To test if a PDGCode is G4 defined,
    if ( id > PDGCode::G4Threshold ){
       // This code is defined by G4
    }

    - Keep straw material from inactive hots when the track passes inside
    close to the wire.  This reduces the reco momentum shift to < 5 KeV.
    - Add infrastructure to control hit ambiguity on construction, and add
    an option of using MC true ambiguity with MC-based 'pat rec'.
    - Introduce a symmetric fit function for momentum resolution which
      describes the data much better.

6) March 23, 2012 kutschke
   Added codes for a subset of G4 nuclei to MCDataProducts/inc/PDGCode.hh
   Not all nuclei are present, just those that showed up in a 2 hour run of G4.
   This is the start of a bigger project to add the G4 nuclei and ions to this
   enum and to the Particle data table.

    Added g4.useNewMuMinusAtomicCapture switch to control the new G4MuonMinusCapture

      Mu2eG4/inc/QGSP_BERT_HP_MU2E00.hh
      Mu2eG4/inc/QGSP_BERT_HP_MU2E00.icc
      Mu2eG4/src/physicsListDecider.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/toggleProcesses.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_mucapture.txt

    Added removing muMinusCaptureAtRest from muons and Decay (if
    present) from muatoms; added G4MuAtomDecay back to GenericMuAtom;
    factored out pname; corrected messages; used verboseLevel
      mucapture/src/G4MuonMinusCapture.cc

    Added MuAtomDecay
      MCDataProducts/inc/ProcessCode.hh

    Other affected files are:
      Mu2eG4/src/PhysicsProcessInfo.cc
      Mu2eG4/test/g4test_mucapture.fcl
      mucapture/src/G4MuAtom.cc
      mucapture/src/G4MuAtomTable.cc
      mucapture/src/G4MuonMinusAtomicCapture.cc

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
    - Now it initializes G4 only on the first beginRun call.
    - Previously it did so on every beginRun call, which meant that we
      were limited to one run per job.  We now have a use case that
      requires multiple runs per job.
    - The G4 geometry may not NOT be changed at new runs.  We may allow this some day.
    - On subsequent beginRun calls all other bookkeeping is done.

   To implement the above we needed to tweak:
   Mu2eG4/inc/SteppingAction.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc
     - Split the beginRun method into beginRun and finishConstruction.  The latter
       is only called at the first beginRun.

   Fixed some targets of opportunity:
     Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/generateFieldMap.cc

    - Fix error when calculating straw wall material when DOCA is larger than
    the straw radius.  Calculate the electronics propagation time error using
    the POCA instead of time division.  These fixes improve the efficiency of the
    Kalman fit by ~15%, and improve the resolution.  Add diagnostics.
    KalmanTests/KalFit,TrkStrawHit,KalFitMC.
    - Remove vestigal 'calorimeter t0' from StrawHitMC.
      HitMakers/MakeStrawHit_module, MakeDriftCellHit_module

2) March 20, 2012 kutschke
   In the creation of the straw hits, add the correction for the flight time
   from the start of the StepPointMC to POCA.

    HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_module.cc

1) March 20, 2012 kutschke
   A new small helper class that will be used in 2), above.
     ConditionsService/inc/MassCache.hh
     ConditionsService/src/MassCache.cc
   In 2), we need, in the middle of a nested loop, to look up information
   in the particle data table. This class implements a caching layer to speed
   up this access.
