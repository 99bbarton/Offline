 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_8

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
    - Now it initializes G4 only on the first beginRun call.
    - Previously it did so on every beginRun call, which meant that we
      were limited to one run per job.  We now have a use case that
      requires multiple runs per job.
    - The G4 geometry may not NOT be changed at new runs.  We may allow this some day.
    - On subsequent beginRun calls all other bookkeeping is done.

   To implement the above we needed to tweak:
   Mu2eG4/inc/SteppingAction.hh
   Mu2eG4/src/SteppingAction.cc
     - Split the beginRun method into beginRun and finishConstruction.  The latter
       is only called at the first beginRun.

   Fixed some targets of opportunity:
     Mu2eG4/src/StackingAction.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/generateFieldMap.cc

    - Fix error when calculating straw wall material when DOCA is larger than
    the straw radius.  Calculate the electronics propagation time error using
    the POCA instead of time division.  These fixes improve the efficiency of the
    Kalman fit by ~15%, and improve the resolution.  Add diagnostics.
    KalmanTests/KalFit,TrkStrawHit,KalFitMC.
    - Remove vestigal 'calorimeter t0' from StrawHitMC.
      HitMakers/MakeStrawHit_module, MakeDriftCellHit_module

   In the creation of the straw hits, add the correction for the flight time
   from the start of the StepPointMC to POCA.

    HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_module.cc

   A new small helper class that will be used in 2), above.
     ConditionsService/inc/MassCache.hh
     ConditionsService/src/MassCache.cc
   In 2), we need, in the middle of a nested loop, to look up information
   in the particle data table. This class implements a caching layer to speed
   up this access.
