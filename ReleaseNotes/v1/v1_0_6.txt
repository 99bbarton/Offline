   The _readouts data member of RecoDataProducts/inc/CaloCrystalHit.hh
   was not correctly initialized.  It's key contained the Id of the CaloHit,
   not the position of the CaloHit in the CaloHitCollection; this is fixed.
     HitMakers/src/MakeCaloCrystalHits_module.cc

   Provide an additional functor to help with the above fix.
     Mu2eUtilities/inc/sort_functors.hh

   The only code to use this data member had a work around to fix the
   problem.  The work around is now removed:
