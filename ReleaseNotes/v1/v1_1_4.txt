 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_4

12) December 14, 2011 gandr

    Various VirtualDetector clean ups.

    Implemenent new virtual detectors to tune the ExtMonFNAL selection channel.

11) December 12, 2011 gandr

    Implement collimators for ExtMonFNAL.

10) December 8, 2011 genser

   Added TT_Back a Virtual Detector at the Back (downstream) face of the tracker
    MCDataProducts/inc/VirtualDetectorId.hh
    VirtualDetectorGeom/src/VirtualDetector.cc
   Used VirtualDetectorId enum_type and name instead of hard coded constants in 
    VirtualDetectorGeom/src/VirtualDetectorMaker.cc
   Used VirtualDetectorId enum_type; added TT_Back VD; used VD names (not
   numbers) for geant4 volume names; minimally restructured code of
    Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
   Explicitly added geant4 visibility attribute parameters in
    Mu2eG4/test/protonBeamDump_v01.txt

   Add extinction monitor uci design, directory ExtinctionMonitorUCIGeom created.
   4 collimators with shielding are placed in extmonuci envelope.
   constructExtMonUCI is added in Mu2G4, GeometryService is also updated.

8) December 8, 2011 gandr

   Create concrete walls around the new hall.

7) December 8, 2011 gandr
   
   The physical hall air has a more complicated shape then G4Box.
   Remove the notion of "hall center" and "half size" from geometry.
   There is still a formal box of hall air, but this is detail 
   of the chosen G4 geometry implementation.  Beam dump and ExtMonFNAL
   are contained within the formal "HallAir" box; the area around
   them is filled with dirt (not air!)

   The concrete walls of the hall are missing from the new
   implementation for the moment.

6) December 6, 2011 gandr
   
   Reduce the amount of volatile information (timestamps, object
   addresses) printed out to make diffing log files easier.

5) December 6, 2011 gandr

   Don't store local offsets in CosmicRayShieldGeom.  It is sufficient
   to know position in mu2e coordinates and parent.centerInMu2e() to 
   place a volume.  This change decouples CosmicRayShieldGeom from
   Mu2eBuilding geometry and will let remove the notion of hallCenter 
   from the latter.

4) November 23, 2011 gandr

   Implement ProtonBeamDump in geometry and G4.  This affects the hall
   construction (one of the hall walls is now created in
   constructProtonBeamDump). ExtMonFNAL is updated appropriately.

   The extmon secondaries channel is still to be coded, it will be a
   part of the ProtonBeamDump.

   The world size has changed to accommodate the new volumes.
   According to g4test_03 printouts with the transport-only physics
   list, the output from most generators and corresponding hits have
   not changed.  The exception is the cosmicToy generator.

3) November 23, 2011 gandr

   Make dirt behave correctly under world size changes.

2) November 23, 2011 gandr
   
   SConstruct: don't require SCONS_DIR to be set - it is not useful for the build.

1) November 19, 2011 kutschke
   setup.sh
    - Upgrade to setup art v1_00_06
    - Choose profile builds of art, geant and full tool chain.
   SConstruct:
    - Change compiler options from -O0 to:
       -O3' -fno-omit-frame-pointer' -DNDEBUG
