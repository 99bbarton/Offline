 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_4

5) December 12, 2011 gandr

   Don't store local offsets in CosmicRayShieldGeom.  It is sufficient
   to know position in mu2e coordinates and parent.centerInMu2e() to 
   place a volume.  This change decouples CosmicRayShieldGeom from
   Mu2eBuilding geometry and will let remove the notion of hallCenter 
   from the latter.

   Implement ProtonBeamDump in geometry and G4.  This affects the hall
   construction (one of the hall walls is now created in
   constructProtonBeamDump). ExtMonFNAL is updated appropriately.

   The extmon secondaries channel is still to be coded, it will be a
   part of the ProtonBeamDump.

   The world size has changed to accommodate the new volumes.
   According to g4test_03 printouts with the transport-only physics
   list, the output from most generators and corresponding hits have
   not changed.  The exception is the cosmicToy generator.

   Make dirt behave correctly under world size changes.

   SConstruct: don't require SCONS_DIR to be set - it is not useful for the build.
