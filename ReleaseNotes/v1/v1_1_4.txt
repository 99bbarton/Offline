 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_4

8) December 8, 2011 gandr

   Create concrete walls around the new hall.

   The physical hall air has a more complicated shape then G4Box.
   Remove the notion of "hall center" and "half size" from geometry.
   There is still a formal box of hall air, but this is detail 
   of the chosen G4 geometry implementation.  Beam dump and ExtMonFNAL
   are contained within the formal "HallAir" box; the area around
   them is filled with dirt (not air!)

   The concrete walls of the hall are missing from the new
   implementation for the moment.

   Reduce the amount of volatile information (timestamps, object
   addresses) printed out to make diffing log files easier.

5) December 6, 2011 gandr

   Don't store local offsets in CosmicRayShieldGeom.  It is sufficient
   to know position in mu2e coordinates and parent.centerInMu2e() to 
   place a volume.  This change decouples CosmicRayShieldGeom from
   Mu2eBuilding geometry and will let remove the notion of hallCenter 
   from the latter.

   Implement ProtonBeamDump in geometry and G4.  This affects the hall
   construction (one of the hall walls is now created in
   constructProtonBeamDump). ExtMonFNAL is updated appropriately.

   The extmon secondaries channel is still to be coded, it will be a
   part of the ProtonBeamDump.

   The world size has changed to accommodate the new volumes.
   According to g4test_03 printouts with the transport-only physics
   list, the output from most generators and corresponding hits have
   not changed.  The exception is the cosmicToy generator.

3) November 23, 2011 gandr

   Make dirt behave correctly under world size changes.

   SConstruct: don't require SCONS_DIR to be set - it is not useful for the build.

   setup.sh
    - Upgrade to setup art v1_00_06
    - Choose profile builds of art, geant and full tool chain.
   SConstruct:
    - Change compiler options from -O0 to:
       -O3' -fno-omit-frame-pointer' -DNDEBUG
