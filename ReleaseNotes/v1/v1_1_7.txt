   New informations can be retrieves from SimParticle. They are:
   
    - Kinetic energy at the beginning of the last step point, through
   double LastKE = sim.preLastStepKineticEnergy()
   given a SimParticle called sim

    - Number of Steps that a particle make before dying, through
   int nTotStep = sim.nSteps()
   always given a SimParticle called sim.

   Another update is about the time folding procedure in the generation
   step. Now it is possible to avoid this feature, writing in the genconfig
   file the line:
   bool FoilParticleGenerator.foldingTimeOption = false;
   The default is true.
