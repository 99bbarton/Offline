           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_7

   Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
     If the following line is present in the geometry file then G4 will use its value to
     set the minimum range cut:

     double g4.minRangeCut  = 0.01;

   The value is a distance in mm. This value is used to set the G4 minimum range cut for
   all particles and all materials.  If the line is not present in the geometry file,
   then our code lets the G4 code take its own default value, which I believe is 1 mm for
   the physics lists we usually use.

   It is possible to improve this by setting the minimum range cut only for certain
   particle/logical-volume combinations.  This will be done when there is demand for it.

   Added two new future stopping processes to  MCDataProducts/inc/ProcessCode.hh

5) February 24, 2012 genser

   Modified Collimator 1 to consist out of  two concentric cylinders
   of different material

4) February 23, 2012 gandr

   Break some of circular dependencies among packages by moving
   Detector.hh and ConditionsEntity.hh into a new package Mu2eInterfaces.

3) February 23, 2012 youzy

   Add virtual planes in ExtMonUCI.

2) February 21, 2012 gandr

   Restructure magnetic field code and implement support for overlapping field maps.

   New informations can be retrieves from SimParticle. They are:

    - Kinetic energy at the beginning of the last step point, through
   double LastKE = sim.preLastStepKineticEnergy()
   given a SimParticle called sim

    - Number of Steps that a particle make before dying, through
   int nTotStep = sim.nSteps()
   always given a SimParticle called sim.

   Another update is about the time folding procedure in the generation
   step. Now it is possible to avoid this feature, writing in the genconfig
   file the line:
   bool FoilParticleGenerator.foldingTimeOption = false;
   The default is true.
