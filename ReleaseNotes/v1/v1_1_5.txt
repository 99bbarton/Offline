 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_5

   Experiment with tighter warning levels for the compiler flags:
   -std=c++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror=return-type -Wextra -Wno-long-long -Winit-self -Woverloaded-virtual
   as suggested by the art team. Most of the additonal warnings generated by this are of the form:
     a) const double function() {.... }
        Complains about an ignored qualifier.
     b) void function ( T const& var ){}
        where var is never used.
     c) DEFINE_ART_MODULE(PtrBug01);
    The ; at the end is superfluous.
    The solution to a) is to remove the useless const and the solution to b) is to remove the name var,
    leaving just the type.

   Move ExtMonUCI backward and out of Remote Control Region,
   add Virtual Plane at the exit of PS and entrance of ExtMonUCI.

   Use the results of 3 to check that each point read from the input
   text file is inside the G4 world.  If the point is outside, there
   are two options: print and informational message and continue or
   throw and exception.  The default is to throw the exception.
   If you want, instead, to skip the offending lines from the inout file,
   add the following to your generator config file:

     bool fromG4BLFile.throwOnOutOfWorld = false;

   Files changed:
     EventGenerator/inc/FromG4BLFile.hh
     EventGenerator/src/FromG4BLFile.cc

   Add method two methods to check to see if a point, given in
   Mu2e coordinates, is inside the G4 world volume; one method
   returns a bool, the other throws an exception if the test fails.
     GeometryService/inc/WorldG4.hh

   The Mau7 field maps have been released in:
     /grid/fermiapp/mu2e/DataFiles/BFieldMaps/Mau7
   These are written in Mu2e coordinates.  Previous field maps
   were written in G4beamline coordinates.  We defined a convention
   to document the coordinate system in the field map header.
   The convention is implemented in:
      BFieldGeom/inc/BFieldManagerMaker.hh
      BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc
   Update to make Mau7 fields the default.

   setup.sh
     Update to art v1_00_08.  This fixes the bug that stopped us from
     reading a file if a data product had been dropped but some of its
     descendant data products retained.
