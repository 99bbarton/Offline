           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_5

   Use the results of 3 to check that each point read from the input
   text file is inside the G4 world.  If the point is outside, there
   are two options: print and informational message and continue or
   throw and exception.  The default is to throw the exception.

   Add method two methods to check to see if a point, given in
   Mu2e coordinates, is inside the G4 world volume; one method
   returns a bool, the other throws an exception if the test fails.

   The Mau7 field maps have been released in:
     /grid/fermiapp/mu2e/DataFiles/BFieldMaps/Mau7
   These are written in Mu2e coordinates.  Previous field maps
   were written in G4beamline coordinates.  We defined a convention
   to document the coordinate system in the field map header.
   The convention is implemented in:
      BFieldGeom/inc/BFieldManagerMaker.hh
      BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc
   Update to make Mau7 fields the default.

   setup.sh
     Update to art v1_00_08.  This fixes the bug that stopped us from
     reading a file if a data product had been dropped but some of its
     descendant data products retained.
