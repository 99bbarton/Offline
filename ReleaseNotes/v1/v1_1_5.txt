           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_5

2) January 21, 2012 kutschke
   The Mau7 field maps have been released in:
     /grid/fermiapp/mu2e/DataFiles/BFieldMaps/Mau7
   These are written in Mu2e coordinates.  Previous field maps
   were written in G4beamline coordinates.  We defined a convention
   to document the coordinate system in the field map header.
   The convention is implemented in:
      BFieldGeom/inc/BFieldManagerMaker.hh
      BFieldGeom/src/BFieldManagerMaker.cc
   Update to make Mau7 fields the default.

   setup.sh
     Update to art v1_00_08.  This fixes the bug that stopped us from
     reading a file if a data product had been dropped but some of its
     descendant data products retained.
