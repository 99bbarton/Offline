 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_0

16) September 19, 2011 kutschke
    Added endJob printout to Filters/src/MinimumHits_module.cc

15) September 18, 2011 kutschke
    Removed maybe_ref.hh from Mu2eUtilties. Now use the version from cetlib.
    This triggered changes to a few other include files.

14) September 15, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay
    -Changed the view options. Now, the side view and end view keep the aspect ratio.

13) September 12, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -The analyze method of the module cds back to the original gPad and gDirectory after each event.
    -If the Quit button is pressed, an exception is thrown so that one doesn't have to wait for the remaining events to be processed.

12) September 7, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -Added an option to draw the graph of the Kalman residuals.

11) September 3, 2011 ehrlich
    EventDisplay:
    -Added the option of saving the event display content into a Root file.
    -Added keyboard commands to move and rotatate the event display content.

10) August 26, 2011 onoratog
    New vacuum added, still not in use as default, made by N2 at 10e-4 Torr

9) August 26, 2011 onoratog
   The input file for stopped muons at the ST can be changed now at run time
   as a configuration parameter.
   The file used at the moment is still the default one. If one want to change
   it, he has to add this line in the genconfig file

   string conversionGun.STfilename = "complete path of the file"
   (for the conversion gun)
   and similar for the other generators that use this file.
 
8) August 25, 2011 onoratog
   A new background generator has been added. It is EjectedPhotonGun, and it
   simulates the photon coming out from Aluminum foils after nuclear muon
   capture. The configuration file 
   Mu2eG4/test/genconfig_05.txt
   has been modified to include configuration parameters for this new
   background gun. The syntax is identical to the ejectedProton(Neutron).

7) August 23, 2011 kutschke
   Added an enum for the virtual detectors.  Used the model of GenId and 
   ProcessId so that << prints out both the number and a name.
    MCDataProducts/inc/VirtualDetectorId.hh 
    MCDataProducts/src/VirtualDetectorId.cc       

6) August 22, 2011, genser
      Added a timing printout for use with the fast profiling tools
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4RunManager.cc

5) August 14, 2011 ehrlich
   Updated track colors in EventDisplay

4) August 14, 2011 vbiliyar
   Modified EventGenerator/src/EjectedNeutronGun.cc and
   EventGenerator/inc/EjectedNeutronGun.hh to enable switching between
   different models of neutron spectra. Added the neutron spectrum model 
   from doc-db 1619.
   
3) August 7, 2011 ehrlich
   Updated Kalman Tracks/Hits in EventDisplay

2) August 4, 2011 genser

   Changed offset calculations to (re?)enable movements of the mu2e
   coordinate system within the G4 world volume in preparation for the
   world volume extension to accommodate more components
   Changed the arguments to add more reference frame flexibility; used
   mu2e reference frame for offset calculations; added diagnostic
   printout:
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructDummyStoppingTarget.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructStoppingTarget.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/constructDummyStoppingTarget.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructProtonAbsorber.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructStoppingTarget.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
   As above, plus added verbosity level config file dependence:
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
   Added a verbosity argument for G4 world construction; added comments
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

1) August 3, 2011 fischler

   1. Moduified Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v2.txt, which adjusts the geometry 
      specification for the TTracker, to correct the Z-spacing discrepancy
      noted in DocDB #1744.  The spacing nopw matches that of the TTracker
      chapter in the CDR, DocDB #1342.
