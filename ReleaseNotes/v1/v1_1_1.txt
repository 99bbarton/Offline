 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_1

2) October 14, 2001 kutschke
   art::OrphanHandle is obsolete.
   There were a few vestigial references to it remaining.
   Removed unnecessary #include directives:
     MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc

   Removed obsolete files:
     Mu2eG4/inc/finalizeSimParticle.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/finalizeStepPointMC.hh

   Changed setup.sh to use:
     setup art v0_07_16 -qa3:debug
     setup geant4 v4_9_4_p02 -qa3
     setup scons v1_3_0b -qgcc45

   The new version of art is required for event mixing.
   The new version of G4 is moving up to the most recent version.
   The change to scons is only that it is built against a new version of
   python; the update to python was driven by Mac compatibility issues.
