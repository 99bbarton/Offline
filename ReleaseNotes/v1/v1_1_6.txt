 Still under construction

           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v1_1_6

9) February 9, 2012, kutschke
   SeedService/src/SeedService_module.cc
     Due to limitations in the MixFilter template we need to use getSeed
     inside the produce method.  Remove the requirement that getSeed may
     only be called from the c'tor or beginRun method.  We plan to
     restore the requirement once MixFilter is fixed.

   Remove cosmicDYB from this example and add ejectedProtonGun.  The
   reason is that cosmicDYB has a very slow initialization, more than
   1 CPU minute. I wanted to keep a generator that makes positive tracks
   for pedagodical purposes.

   Bug fix the default maximum enegry, was 0.1 MeV and is now 300 MeV.
    EventGenerator/src/EjectedProtonGun.cc

5) February 8, 2012, kutschke
   Changed default cos(theta) range to [-1.0,1.0] in many places:
      EventGenerator/src/ConversionGun.cc
      EventGenerator/src/ParticleGun.cc

   Removed many obsolete files.

   Many .py files. When we bulk translated the .py files to .fcl
   files, not all .fcl files were checked.  I have kept the .py for .fcl
   files that I have not personally checked.

   Mu2eG4/test/g4test_04* are obsolete and were removed.

   fcl/standardProducers.fcl
      wrapFiles is now the default for all mixing parmeter sets

2) February 8, 2012, kutschke
   This script was added a few days ago but this is the first
   release that is actually read for production use.
   Added tests and fixed a bug in the computation of the base seed.
     bin/updateFCLFile.sh

   Switch all random number engines to using the SeedService.
   This touches all _module files, several SConscript files
   and many .fcl files.  Some fcl files still need to be converted.

   For introductory information seed:
     http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/RandomBasics.shtml

   For complete details see:
      http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/Random.shtml

   New files:
   fcl/standardServices.fcl - define two standard configurations

   I took the opportunity to remove tabs from many files, remove stale
   or inappropriate comments and and to perform some other housekeeping.


   Add SeedService_service to the link list.

   Get seeds from the SeedService. Reorder includes; untabify.

     HitMakers/src/MakeStrawHit_module.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc

   Remove obsolte seed : [value] parameters. Add SeedService.
   Lots of housekeeping.

   Bugfix: replace g4SteppingAction.killInHallAir with
   g4SteppingAction.killInTheseVolumes."
