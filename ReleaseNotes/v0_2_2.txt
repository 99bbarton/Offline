    The framework is now ready for beamline studies. List of changes:

    - New generator G4BeamlineGenerator_plugin.cc. It is based on the
      same FromG4BLFile generator, but adds additional collection 
      to the output stream - G4BeamlineInfo - which contains extra 
      information, provided in the input file (in particular, weights).

    - BFieldManagerMaker can now read compressed G4Beamline field maps. 
      File names ended with .gz or .bz2 will be automatically 
      decompressed on-the-fly.

    - Additional new data member in StepPointMC - proper time. This is 
      needed in some beamline studies. All modules which produce 
      StepPointMCs or StepPointG4, were updated correspondingly. 

    - It is possible now to switch off decays of particles of particular 
      type in the configuration file. Example is shown in beamline_geom.txt

    New abstract class BFMapBase, which describes interface to get 
    B-field at particular location. BFMap and BFieldManager now inheret
    from BFMapBase.

    BFieldManegerMaker can now read G4Beamline files. Configuration
    example is shown in Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.py.
