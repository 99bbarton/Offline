    Analyses/src/InteractiveRoot_plugin.cc 
    Analyses/test/InteractiveRoot.py 

    This is an example module to show how to run interactive root 
    from within a module.  If several modules want to do this, they need to
    figure out how to cooperate so that only one module creates the
    TApplication.  Probably we should make the TApplication a feature
    of the TFileService ( optional, selectable at run-time, feature?).

    The framework is now ready for beamline studies. List of changes:

    - New generator G4BeamlineGenerator_plugin.cc. It is based on the
      same FromG4BLFile generator, but adds additional collection 
      to the output stream - G4BeamlineInfo - which contains extra 
      information, provided in the input file (in particular, weights).

    - BFieldManagerMaker can now read compressed G4Beamline field maps. 
      File names ended with .gz or .bz2 will be automatically 
      decompressed on-the-fly.

    - Additional new data member in StepPointMC - proper time. This is 
      needed in some beamline studies. All modules which produce 
      StepPointMCs or StepPointG4, were updated correspondingly. 

    - It is possible now to switch off decays of particles of particular 
      type in the configuration file. Example is shown in beamline_geom.txt

    The event number lists have a new behaviour; it is possible to enable
    printout for all events.  This is selected by making a list with
    a single entry with a value of -1 ( an illegal event number).

    Added code in the user stepping action to kill tracks if:
        - their kinetic energy has dropped below a given cutoff
     or - they enter the hall air volume

    This code can be enabled by variables added to geom_01.txt.  
    They are off by default in geom_01txt .  
    In beamline_geom.txt they are on by default

    There is probably a smarter way to implement the low kinetic
    energy cut off but the present solution works.

    New abstract class BFMapBase, which describes interface to get 
    B-field at particular location. BFMap and BFieldManager now inheret
    from BFMapBase.

    BFieldManegerMaker can now read G4Beamline files. Configuration
    example is shown in Mu2eG4/test/beamline_geom.py.
