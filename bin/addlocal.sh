# Setup the environment to tell mute to look for certain files first in
# the local directory and then in the base release. This script requires
# that you have already setup a base release.  The files that can be looked
# in this manner include the geometry file(s), the generator configuration
# file(s), the conditions data file(s), the particle data tables and
# the magnetic field maps.  This list may be extended in the future.
#
# The code that opens input event-data files does not use this mechanism.
#

# Check that this is being used correctly
