        Atlas of Example .fcl Files to Drive FMtool
        
Fairly minimal files that analyze various available data sets:
--------------------------------------------------------------

example_bernstein_1.fcl         Feb fitting of 50K CE's, 194K DIO's, 2M RPC's

example_bernstein_2.fcl         April fitting of .5M CE's, 3M DIO's, 2M RPC's

example_brown_1.fcl             April fitting of .1M CE's , 10M DIO's (spread 
                                over 400 original files, consolidated into 4,
                                flat on 95-105, using diowt), 2M RPC's

example_brown_2.fcl             July/August fitting of .1M CE's (same as brown_1,
                                generated and fitted in April), 1M DIO's (spread
                                over 40 file, not consolidated, generated at fitted
                                in late July, using diowt), 2M RPC's.
                                This takes a while to run (about 75 seconds) because 
                                of the 40 DIO files.  (But it is much quicker to rerun!)

example_hodges_49foil.fcl       August fitting of .1M CE's, .1M DIO's, 2M RPC's
                                without proton absorber
