// A toy model of the DS, cyrostats+coils, vacuum
//
// The solenoid itself is a cylindrical shell.  Inside
// of it are 1 physical volume, and 3 vacuum volumes:
//
//   F - the front face of the coils+cryostats, made of same material as the det. solenoid
//   1 - DS1, a small piece of DS vacuum that surrounds TS5.
//   2 - DS2, the upstream part of the DS vacuum, that has a graded field.
//   3 - DS3, the downstream part of the DS vacuum, that may have a uniform field.
//
// All volumes except 3 are (annular) cylinders; 3 is now a polycone
// object that has a cylinder that extends beyond the detector
// solenoid, allowing for the MBS, which extends from inside the
// solenoid to outside of it.
//
// NOTE 1: the size of DS3 is constrained by the placement of DS2
// vacuum volume, the z extent of the DS itself, and the end location
// of the MBS, outside of the det. solenoid.  Therefore a
// toyDS3.halfLength parameter is not included below as it is superfluous
// and could possibly lead to geometrical inconsistencies.
//
// NOTE 2: The front face is now designed to be flush with the edge of
// the DS.
//
// NOTE 3: halflength of DS is now consistent with CDR of 10750 mm.
// Half length of DS1 has been adjusted such that given an assumed
// rTorus of 2929 mm, and TS5 half-length of 500 mm, the start of the
// DS is at 3239 mm, consistent with CDR.
