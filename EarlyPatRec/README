	The intent of the EarlyPatRec directory
	---------------------------------------

Several approaches can be taken to pattern recognition in the T-tracker,
and it is too soon to say that one will be best and disregard the rest.
So in principle, there will be multiple PatRec algorithms written.
	
There are certain capabilities, structure or class definitions, and tools
which in principle ought to be usable as preliminary steps in more than
one of these algorithms.  For example, getting a nice list of Doublets and
Triplets may be of value for various algorithms, and could be shared.  

We are not trying to delude ourselves that the designers of two algorithms
will agree on the specifics of what is best in (say) a Doublet class.  But
at least area this will give a starting point and code which the various 
designers can concretely argue about, and perhaps eventually come to common
understandings about. 

The capabilities and classes we are shooting for at this moment are:

1. Understanding of  straw geometry in a way convenient for EarlyPatRec.
2. Populate the hit information in a frame from MC.
3. Perhaps going from pulse train within microbunch, to straw hits in frame.
   	But we may not need this right away, so intent is to do it later.
4. Form ActiveStrawClusters from hit information.
5. Form Panel Line Segments.
6. Form Doublets.
7. Form (self-consistent) Triplets and Quadruplets.
